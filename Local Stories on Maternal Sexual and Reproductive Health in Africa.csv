UNFPA Lesotho UN agencies ,24th February 2023,,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/woman-dies-every-two-minutes-due-pregnancy-or-childbirth-un-agencies-3,"Every two minutes, a woman dies during pregnancy or childbirth, according to the latest estimates released in a report by United Nations agencies today. This report, Trends in maternal mortality, reveals alarming setbacks for women’s health over recent years, as maternal deaths either increased or stagnated in nearly all regions of the world. 
“While pregnancy should be a time of immense hope and a positive experience for all women, it is tragically still a shockingly dangerous experience for millions around the world who lack access to high quality, respectful health care,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO). “These new statistics reveal the urgent need to ensure every woman and girl has access to critical health services before, during and after childbirth, and that they can fully exercise their reproductive rights.” The report, which tracks maternal deaths nationally, regionally and globally from 2000 to 2020, shows there were an estimated 287 000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2020. This marks only a slight decrease from 309 000 in 2016 when the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into effect. While the report presents some significant progress in reducing maternal deaths between 2000 and 2015, gains largely stalled, or in some cases even reversed, after 2015. In two of the eight UN regions – Europe and Northern America, and Latin America and the Caribbean – the maternal mortality rate increased from 2016 to 2020, by 17% and 15% respectively. Elsewhere, the rate stagnated. The report notes, however, that progress is possible. For example, two regions – Australia and New Zealand, and Central and Southern Asia – experienced significant declines (by 35% and 16% respectively) in their maternal mortality rates during the same period, as did 31 countries across the world.“For millions of families, the miracle of childbirth is marred by the tragedy of maternal deaths,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “No mother should have to fear for her life while bringing a baby into the world, especially when the knowledge and tools to treat common complications exist. Equity in healthcare gives every mother, no matter who they are or where they are, a fair chance at a safe delivery and a healthy future with their family.” In total numbers, maternal deaths continue to be largely concentrated in the poorest parts of the world and in countries affected by conflict. In 2020, about 70% of all maternal deaths were in sub-Saharan Africa. In nine countries facing severe humanitarian crises, maternal mortality rates were more than double the world average (551 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, compared to 223 globally). “This report provides yet another stark reminder of the urgent need to double down on our commitment to women and adolescent health,” said Juan Pablo Uribe, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank, and Director of the Global Financing Facility. “With immediate action, more investments in primary health care and stronger, more resilient health systems, we can save lives, improve health and well-being, and advance the rights of and opportunities for women and adolescents.”  Severe bleeding, high blood pressure, pregnancy-related infections, complications from unsafe abortion, and underlying conditions that can be aggravated by pregnancy (such as HIV/AIDS and malaria) are the leading causes of maternal deaths. These are all largely preventable and treatable with access to high-quality and respectful healthcare.  Community-centered primary health care can meet the needs of women, children and adolescents and enable equitable access to critical services such as assisted births and pre- and postnatal care, childhood vaccinations, nutrition and family planning. However, underfunding of primary health care systems, a lack of trained health care workers, and weak supply chains for medical products are threatening progress.  Roughly a third of women do not have even four of a recommended eight antenatal checks or receive essential postnatal care, while some 270 million women lack access to modern family planning methods. Exercising control over their reproductive health – particularly decisions about if and when to have children – is critical to ensure that women can plan and space childbearing and protect their health. Inequities related to income, education, race or ethnicity further increase risks for marginalized pregnant women, who have the least access to essential maternity care but are most likely to experience underlying health problems in pregnancy. ""It is unacceptable that so many women continue to die needlessly in pregnancy and childbirth. Over 280,000 fatalities in a single year is unconscionable,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “We can and must do better by urgently investing in family planning and filling the global shortage of 900,000 midwives so that every woman can get the lifesaving care she needs. We have the tools, knowledge and resources to end preventable maternal deaths; what we need now is the political will.""The COVID-19 pandemic may have further held back progress on maternal health. Noting the current data series ends in 2020, more data will be needed to show the true impacts of the pandemic on maternal deaths. However, COVID-19 infections can increase risks during pregnancy, so countries should take action to ensure pregnant women and those planning pregnancies have access to COVID-19 vaccines and effective antenatal care. ""Reducing maternal mortality remains one of the most pressing global health challenges,” said John Wilmoth, Director of the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “Ending preventable maternal deaths and providing universal access to quality maternal health care require sustained national and international efforts and unwavering commitments, particularly for the most vulnerable populations.  It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every mother, everywhere, survives childbirth, so that she and her children can thrive."" The report reveals that the world must significantly accelerate progress to meet global targets for reducing maternal deaths, or else risk the lives of over 1 million more women by 2030.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pedestric Aids Foundation,May 2017,Leribe,https://www.pedaids.org/2017/05/10/a-mosotho-mothers-relief-saving-infant-lives-through-early-diagnosis-and-care/,"Today, Lebele Mathato has brought her daughter, Nyakallo, for her 6-week check-up at the Maputsoe Clinic in Leribe, Lesotho.  Nyakallo is alert and growing well. But as a woman living with HIV, Lebele has a lingering concern. Has she transmitted the incurable virus to her daughter during pregnancy or childbirth?
Lebele well remembers her anxiety of several years back when she brought her infant son, Tuma, to the clinic to determine his HIV status. When he was 6 weeks old, a health worker took blood samples from Tuma’s heel and applied them to a special card. Once the blood spots had dried, the card was shipped to a laboratory in Maseru for analysis to see if he had been infected with HIV. Lebele had to wait more than a month for the results.In the end she was relieved to learn that Tuma was HIV-negative. But the long wait was hard for her—especially because like many Basotho women, she lives in a village far from the town center and must walk for several hours to get to the clinic. The longer an HIV-positive infant goes undiagnosed, the more likely they are to fall ill or die. Without treatment, 3 out of every 10 HIV-positive infants die before their first birthday, most within the first 3 months of life. In contrast, today, Lebele will receive the results of her daughter’s test by the time that she leaves the clinic. In January 2017, through funding from Unitaid, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) installed a point-of-care machine in the clinic for diagnosing the HIV status of young infants. Using innovative point-of-care technologies, test results are returned quicker as the sample does not need to travel to the central laboratory anymore; but is instead analyzed in the clinic. This allows HIV-positive infants to be diagnosed and initiated on life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART) on the same day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pedestric Aids Foundation,December 2016,Maputsoe,https://www.pedaids.org/2016/12/13/early-infant-diagnosis-in-lesotho-bringing-the-test-to-the-baby/,"The training room at the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Health Centre in the dusty border town of Maputsoe, Lesotho, is filled with women dressed in white. Several of them crowd around a cube-shaped machine, small enough to fit inside a plastic grocery bag, on the tabletop at the front.
A woman pours a few drops of fake blood into a tube inside a cassette-sized canister, then slides the canister into the cube-shaped machine. “Reading cartridge…” reads the screen. A ripple of excitement spreads through the group.
These women aren’t highly trained nurses or lab technicians; they are lay health workers. The machine they are learning to use will test babies for HIV.Any adult who has had a rapid HIV test knows that the process is simple, at least logistically. Hold out a finger, feel the prick, wait nervously, receive results a few minutes later.
The process is more complicated for newborn babies. Because of maternal antibodies in a newborn’s blood, babies need a more sophisticated virologic test to determine their HIV status, and those tests can’t be performed on the spot. Up until recently the best way to test a baby was through a dried blood spot—or DBS—test, which requires collecting a blood sample from the baby, drying the blood on a test slide, and sending the slide away for analysis in an offsite lab.In a country like Lesotho, the complicated logistics of processing DBS tests can mean life or death for an HIV-infected baby. The country has notoriously mountainous terrain, with substantial numbers of people living in hard-to-reach areas. There is only one laboratory in the country equipped to process DBS tests, located in the capital city of Maseru. This set of factors means it can take several weeks, even a couple of months, for DBS results to be returned to the clinic of origin. Once the results are in, it can be difficult to track down the affected mother-and-baby pair to deliver the news.An HIV-infected baby’s first few months are critical, and without immediate treatment the baby has a high probability of death. About 30 percent of HIV-infected babies die before they turn one, and many more become critically ill. The majority die before their fifth birthday.
Babies living with HIV need to be identified and treated as early and quickly as possible – preferably at the point of care (POC) during their first post-natal health visit. The cube-shaped early infant diagnosis (EID) machine at the Maputsoe SDA Health Centre will make this possible.
In partnership with UNITAID, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) is dispersing these machines—together with a slightly larger version for bigger health facilities—to a number of pilot sites around Lesotho. The machine tests a baby’s blood for HIV in about 90 minutes as the mother and baby wait—printing the result on a small portable printer. If the baby tests positive, (s)he can be initiated onto treatment right then, before leaving the clinic.This improvement to the EID process is expected to have a huge impact on the number of babies who test for HIV and actually receive their results, as well as the number of HIV-positive babies who are initiated onto treatment before it’s too late.By the end of 2018, Lesotho will have 29 EID testing “hub” sites using the POC machines, with an additional 160 “spoke sites” feeding samples to the hub sites. The main goal of the EGPAF-UNITAID project is to reduce the turnaround time for delivering HIV test results to a baby’s caregiver from the current 30-60 days to zero days at hub sites, and seven days at spoke sites.The project seeks to achieve a 20 percent increase in HIV testing among infants in Lesotho by 2019.The EID POC machines began arriving in Lesotho in late November, and were formally unveiled to the public on World AIDS Day (December 1) by Lesotho’s Queen ‘Masenate Mohato Seeiso. The machines are already in use at a couple of sites.The trainees at Maputsoe SDA hospital used fake blood and blood from an adult’s finger while learning to use the POC EID machines. Soon though, they will be pricking babies’ heels and feeding the few drops of blood into the cube-shaped machine on the table. Just like that, children’s lives will change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNAIDS,16 July 2009,,https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2009/july/20090716lesotho,"“Strengthened services for maternal health, for reproductive health and for paediatric health will mean we can prevent mothers from dying and babies from becoming infected with HIV in Lesotho and around the world,” said Mr Michel Sidibé, UNAIDS Executive Director. Strengthened services for maternal health, for reproductive health and for paediatric health will mean we can prevent mothers from dying and babies from becoming infected with HIV in Lesotho and around the world, Mr Sidibé was speaking during his official visit to Lesotho which ended with a visit to the children’s ward and mother and child health section of the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Maseru. He was accompanied by the Minister of Health Dr Mphu Ramatlapeng. Mr Sidibé earlier was welcomed into the home of Ms Pitso a HIV-positive mother who thanks to access to services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission gave birth 11 months ago to her baby boy Emlyn who is free of HIV. Mr Sidibé listened to Ms Pitso’s hopes for a bright future for her son. Mr Sidibé has Lesotho has made progress in coverage of prevention of mother-to-child transmission services for pregnant women, up from 5% in 2006 to 42% in the first quarter 2009. Without any intervention, an HIV positive pregnant woman’s chances of passing HIV to her baby are 30-40%. Infection transmission is the highest during pregnancy and delivery, but also during breastfeeding, especially if breast milk is mixed with other feeding. With the provision of a comprehensive prevention services, the transmission rate can be reduced to less than 2%.“Lesotho is a model in its achievements, particularly in the field of preventing mother to child transmission of HIV,” said Mr Sidibé.At the Queen Elizabeth II hospital, Mr Sidibé also acknowledged the contribution and commitment of health care workers. Addressing staff shortages in health and social sectors has been an aim of the Government of Lesotho who in partnership with the UN have developed an emergency human resources strategic plan, which includes ways of attracting, training and retaining health personnel.His Majesty, King Letsie III hosted a meeting yesterday with the Executive Director. Mr Sidibé also met with and Prime Minister Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili-Qhobosheaneng, members of Lesotho’s national AIDS Commission, and other senior government officials.During his two day visit he participated in a joint civil society meeting with the Lesotho Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS (LENEPWA), Lesotho Inter-Religious AIDS Consortium (LIRAC) and Lesotho Council of NGOs (LCN). The organizations stressed the need for strengthened institutional capacity and delivery of meaningful and evidence based programmes to achieve a unified response to HIV.Mr Sidibé, addressing the participants who are openly living with HIV, said “It is because of your experience and your life that we have managed to break the conspiracy of silence surrounding HIV and AIDS.” Mr Sidibé had a meeting with UN staff and the UN Country Team followed by lunch catered by Positively Masutsa, a catering service exclusively employing HIV positive people.
An evening event hosted by acting Minister of Foreign Affairs & International Relations, Mr Semano Sekatle included the launch of the first Joint UN programme on AIDS in Lesotho. Launching the joint programme Ms Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie, the country’s UN Resident Coordinator said: “Lesotho deserves a unified UN that is not fragmented, that does not duplicate efforts and resources, but stands in a united front against the scourge of HIV.”
Lesotho has the third highest adult HIV prevalence in the world with 23% of those aged 15 to 49 living with HIV. Multiple sexual relationships are a major risk factor in Lesotho’s hyper endemic HIV situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,8th May 2018,Mahole,https://www.pih.org/article/one-mothers-fear-lesotho-will-my-newborn-also-live-hiv,"Thabo Lerata* was born at 1 p.m. on Jan. 1, 2018, the first baby of the New Year to be delivered at Holy Cross Health Center in the highland district of Mohale’s Hoek, Lesotho.
His 36-year-old mother, Mathabo Lerata,* made quite a trip to bring him into the world.  Lerata left their home around 9 a.m. that day—while in the early stages of labor—to begin walking to Holy Cross. The trip would require crossing a broad field atop a plateau, then descending a switchbacking dirt road to the closest paved road, at the bottom of a steep slope. She carried a few belongings as the hot day began. January is the heart of summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and the sun can beat down heavily on the high-altitude ridges of Mohale’s Hoek, in Lesotho’s southwest. South Africa entirely surrounds Lesotho, a small, agricultural nation that proudly calls itself the Mountain Kingdom.Partners In Health (PIH), known in Lesotho as Bo-mphato Litsebeletsong Tsa Bophelo, has worked in the country for more than 12 years. That work significantly expanded in 2014, when PIH began supporting Lesotho’s national health reform, as the primary technical advisor to the Ministry of Health. The reform’s goals include reducing child mortality and mother-to-child transmission of HIV, improving maternal health, and combating HIV and TB, of which Lesotho has some of the world’s highest prevalence rates. PIH and the ministry are piloting the reform in four districts, including Mohale’s Hoek, but the goal is to expand nationwide and ensure that all of Lesotho’s 2.2 million people have access to health care, in the most remote locations.  The Leratas’ one-story home fits that description.It would take Lerata more than an hour to reach the PIH-supported Holy Cross on New Year’s Day. Stepping out her front door, she had views all around of rugged mountains that sometimes resembled the American Southwest. She first crossed the top of the plateau—a wide field strewn with large rocks, patches of dirt, and thin, faded tracks. Lerata later said it can get very windy up there, and very cold in the winter. On clear days, she can see across the nearby border into South Africa. On the other side of the plateau is the village of Ha Mohlekana, a small cluster of homes and buildings near the dirt road that leads down the slope.
Lerata makes the walk all the time, as do her 15-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, and said the trip from her door to pavement takes about 30 minutes. That seems optimistic at first glance, but she’s lived there for more than 13 years and says it confidently—30 minutes.
From the paved road, it’s usually 30 more minutes by foot to Holy Cross.Unless, of course, you’re pregnant. Or in labor.Lerata said her contractions with Thabo started Dec. 31, but she initially didn’t realize they were contractions, because they felt different than they had with her first two children.
Her first two children were born at the district hospital in Mohale’s Hoek, farther away from the family’s home than Holy Cross.
The proximity of the health center—relative proximity, at least—was a blessing with her third child.
Lerata's village health worker, Malerato Tsoelesa, had visited her at least twice a week since before her pregnancy with Thabo. Tsoelesa regularly checked on the entire family, to accompany Lerata and her children to the PIH-supported Holy Cross for free doctor visits, and then to guide Lerata's prenatal care. In all, Tsoelesa works with seven families around the village. All of them have children. But Tsoelesa wasn’t able to be at Lerata’s home that morning, because things happened so quickly. Lerata’s husband was away in South Africa, working in mines.  
The resulting situation was vastly different from labor and childbirth in the U.S.—and most other countries around the world, for that matter. Walking such a distance and in such rugged conditions while in labor, or even late in pregnancy, would be unthinkable.
But not in Mohale’s Hoek.Lerata told the story offhandedly six weeks later, sitting in her living room and holding Thabo on her lap. She didn’t say whether she had been alone on the morning he was born, or whether she had taken a taxi from the paved road or just continued walking to the health center.  
Those details didn’t seem to matter all that much.
Lerata acknowledged that people often exclaim when she tells the story of that day, but said she shrugs it off, herself, saying the walk wasn’t too bad because her labor started gradually. 
Besides, as she told the story on the morning of Feb. 13, she had something else on her mind. Thabo was due for his six-week checkup at Holy Cross, which would include a PCR test (the acronym stands for polymerase chain reaction). The test would be held the next day, and Lerata would be able to see the results within about an hour, during the same visit.
The test would be the first indicator of whether Thabo had HIV, like both of his parents.
erata said her husband learned he was HIV-positive in 2008, and has been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) since about that time. She was diagnosed a year later, and also started ART promptly.
Both of their older children are HIV-negative. Those results and both parents’ commitment to ART meant Thabo’s odds were good, too. But there was still a risk.
Dr. Afom Andom, PIH’s lead technical advisor for Lesotho’s national health reform, said that without ART, the risk of pregnant women with HIV passing the virus to their children can reach 40 percent. Transmission can occur in utero, during childbirth and while breastfeeding. 
Lesotho's Ministry of Health and PIH are taking significant steps to reduce that rate. Andom said a scaled-up HIV program, begun in 2016, has made Lesotho the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to implement widespread screening practices known as “test and treat.” The increased screening and a corresponding emphasis on long-term, sustained ART have combined to reduce mother-to-child transmission to less than 6 percent, across 72 health centers in the reform’s four pilot districts. The goal is to ultimately achieve a rate of less than 2 percent.
Lerata consistently uses Holy Cross for her ART and services for her children—all three of them have received immunizations, checkups and more at the health center.
On the morning of Thabo’s six-week checkup and PCR test, Lerata brought him to Holy Cross in a taxi. She said the trip cost 6 South African rand (US$0.50). The rand is commonly used in Lesotho, along with the national currency, the loti.
The mood inside Holy Cross that morning was festive. It was Valentine’s Day and several of the nurses were wearing red, some because of the holiday and others just because. 
Rain began falling against a window as Lerata fed Thabo in a clinic room around 10 a.m. He was fussy and hungry, which his mother described as common. He had been crying, eating and moving around more than his two older siblings had when they were infants.
As registered nurse midwife Mamakama Mofolo began the checkup, Thabo soon began crying again.“Phephi, phephi (Sorry, sorry),” Mofolo said softly, as she checked Thabo’s head circumference, bone development, body length and more, moving from head to toe and repeating the Sesotho apology, pronounced like “peppy.”
As Thabo fussed, another baby could be heard crying in the hallway. Holy Cross serves more than 11,550 people, from villages throughout the region, and was busy that Wednesday morning.
After the checkup, Lerata fed Thabo again, quickly calming him down. Then it was time for his PCR test.
Four counselors were waiting in a small room across the hall. Marelebohile Motlomelo, Makanelolo Mahlatsi, Nthabeleng Ichasake and Matseko Mokhamo gave Lerata pre-test counseling, advising her on the procedure and what the results would mean.
Motlomelo then leaned forward and made small pricks in one of Thabo’s big toes, drawing a few drops of blood. She used a container that resembled a floppy disk to absorb the sample, then placed the container in the health center’s PCR machine.
It’s rare for health centers in Lesotho to have such a machine—most often, samples are sent to district or national labs for analysis. The machine at Holy Cross is supported by multiple aid partners, in response to the high number of infants exposed to HIV in Mohale’s Hoek.
Processing Thabo’s results would take about an hour.In the meantime, Lerata brought her son into a larger room at the health center, for immunizations. Several other mothers held infants in the room, sitting in rows of chairs while waiting for shots.
When it was Thabo’s turn, Nurse Assistant Mookho Matekane kneeled by their chair and gave him vaccines against polio and pneumococcal conjugate, along with a pentavalent, which combines five vaccines into one shot.
Thabo didn’t like the shots, understandably, and began to cry again. It was about 10:50 a.m., less than an hour after he and his mother had arrived at Holy Cross. The healthy, active 6-week-old had had a tough morning.
And it undoubtedly was just as hard for Lerata, as she waited at the health center for PCR results. Infants at risk for HIV also are tested at 14 weeks and at nine months, and then given a definitive test at 18 months, so Thabo’s results that day would be preliminary. But Dr. Andom said the six-week results are a strong early indicator of an infant's status. Changes of that status in later tests are rare. 
Soon enough, Thabo’s results were ready.
Lerata returned to the counseling room, and sat in a chair next to a desk. Motlomelo read the results out loud.
HIV-negative, just like his brother and sister.
Lerata’s eyes watered, and a smile broke across her face. She laughed and took a deep breath, as the results were written in a register and in Thabo’s bukana, a small book kept by the family that contains a child’s birth information, medicines and health history.In the meantime, Lerata brought her son into a larger room at the health center, for immunizations.

“Kea leboha (Thank you),” Lerata said in Sesotho. “Kea leboha.”
The rest of their visit passed quickly. Lerata walked outside to the adjacent, one-room HIV facility, where she received a refill of her ART. A large filing cabinet had drawers labeled for active ART patients, pre-ART, and more.
Next door, pharmacist Malefetsane Letsosa filled the prescription.
Outside, Mary Lesesa, the primary health care coordinator for Mohale’s Hoek, translated more of what Lerata had said in Sesotho after the PCR results were read.
“She was a bit frightened,” Lesesa said. “But when the results came out, she was very happy.""
That emotion was evident as Lerata prepared to leave the health center. She swept Thabo onto her back, snuggled into a baby carrier, and wrapped him securely there with a large, brown-and-peach blanket.
Then Lerata, her 7-year-old son—who had come along that morning—another mother, and Tsoelesa, Lerata’s village health worker, left Holy Cross and proceeded up the road, talking and laughing as they began another long walk home.

Lesotho times,19th August 2016,Leribe,http://lestimes.com/leribe-woman-kills-newborn/,"A 25-year-old Leribe woman, Botlebosele Liaho, is facing murder charges after she allegedly dumped her day-old new-born baby into a pit latrine earlier this month saying she did not have the means to feed him. The Ha-Chonapase woman was arrested after neighbours realised she was no longer pregnant but did not have a new-born baby.
Upon her arrest, Ms Liaho allegedly confessed she dumped the day-old boy child into a pit latrine. “The suspect allegedly claimed she already had a two-year old child whom she was struggling to feed and was in no position to feed another mouth,” said Senior Inspector Motseki.
“It is sad that a woman can kill her own child while we are celebrating African Women’s Month. In any case, the government provides family planning services throughout the country for women who don’t want to conceive.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,28th November 2018,Berea ,https://www.pih.org/article/safe-deliveries-big-smiles-lesotho-health-center,"Kamohelo Phoofolo, 8 months old and bundled in a soft pink, hooded fleece, smiled happily as she sat on her mother’s lap at Mapheleng Health Center in Lesotho. Her mother, 27-year-old Marefiloe Phoofolo, matched her daughter not only in clothing color, but also in disposition. She was all smiles as she talked about the maternal health care she had received at the Partners In Health-supported Mapheleng facility.Phoofolo lives in the village of Ha Matoeba, where homes dot hillsides surrounded by steep ridges. The terrain is so rough, and the region so remote, that doctors from Mapheleng ride horses to the most hard-to-reach communities. Phoofolo doesn’t live quite that far away—her village is within walking distance of the health center—but she stayed at Mapheleng’s maternal waiting home for five days before she gave birth to Kamohelo, to make sure she was close to care when labor began. While there, she received three meals a day, water for bathing and around-the-clock prenatal care. All of it was free.Most importantly, Phoofolo had a safe, healthy childbirth at the health center, where she continues to have postnatal checkups and Kamohelo receives care as a toddler. Her birth was one of more than 30,000 facility-based deliveries—including 6,000 life-saving cesarean sections—provided at PIH-supported facilities around the world in 2017. Globally, PIH provides about two-thirds of its entire services to women and children, with the goal of reducing maternal deaths and ensuring healthy futures for the next generation. That effort is especially vital in Lesotho, a rural, mountainous country surrounded by South Africa. The remote location of many communities, rugged dirt roads and scarcity of resources create enormous health care challenges, including for expectant mothers. One in 61 women in Lesotho will die from pregnancy or childbirth. By comparison, women in Sierra Leone face a 1 in 17 lifetime risk of dying in pregnancy or childbirth—the worst rate in the world—while women in the U.S. face a risk of 1 in 3,800.
Lesotho’s ongoing national health reform is changing that dynamic, and has fueled transformative improvements in just four years. PIH, known locally as Bo-mphato Litsebeletsong Tsa Bophelo, is supporting the reform as the primary technical advisor to Lesotho’s Ministry of Health.  Mapheleng is one of 72 health centers revitalized by the reform. Mapheleng serves about 6,200 people across 28 villages, and—with more nurses, maternal supplies and medicines—has provided facility-based deliveries for hundreds of women like Phoofolo.Facility-based deliveries have increased by 30 percent since 2014 in the reform’s initial four districts. That equates to nearly 4,000 more safe deliveries in 2017 than before the reform.  Kamohelo was one of them. On a sunny, clear February day, Phoofolo talked with two other new mothers in Mapheleng as she held her second child. All three of the women had been referred to Mapheleng by village health workers, who provide health resources and access to care in their communities. Phoofolo said she, too, would encourage pregnant women to use the health center for prenatal care and delivery—to help ensure more safe childbirths, and more newborn smiles, like her daughter’s.

Mission Aviation Fellowship,1st December 2022,Lebakeng,https://maf.org/storyhub/it-takes-a-village-2-2/,"Bryan Eygabroad landed his Cessna 206 at the Lebakeng airstrip high in the mountains of Lesotho. He was unloading cargo when he overheard a group of nurses from the local clinic chattering excitedly in a mix of Sesotho and a Zimbabwean language. The nurse relayed to Bryan that a tragedy had struck the village the night before. A local woman had died shortly after giving birth.The baby survived … but there was no milk or formula in Lebakeng. It had already been hours and the baby needed food—fast.“Looking at my flight schedule for the afternoon,” said Bryan, an MAF pilot, “I realized I was going to finish the day a mere 10 minute-flight away from my current stop. Surely there was something that could be done!” Two clocks were ticking: one counted down how long this new infant could last without nourishment, and the other measured the time until the high winds would begin sweeping over the mostly treeless mountains of Lesotho in the afternoon.If Bryan could not make it back to Lebakeng before the winds picked up, his chances of landing were slim.High in the Mountain Kingdom Like many villages in the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho, Lebakeng is remote.Without an airplane, a trek out would involve a steep hike down a ridge, somehow crossing the wide Senqu River, and then hiking up the opposite mountain—which would only get one to the beginning of a gravel road—with many hours still to go to reach the nearest town.Making this trip in the case of a medical emergency—or with a newborn baby—would simply be impossible. An MAF airplane is the only way. Although this land and its people are beautiful, the needs here are great. Lesotho has an alarmingly high HIV rate, and there is little infrastructure in the remote parts of the country. Because of your support, MAF is able to partner with organizations like the Lesotho Flying Doctor Service and the Lesotho Flying Pastors, among others, to bring healing and hope to the people of this small nation.
Teamwork The MAF team in Lesotho is made up of western missionaries like Bryan, along with several local Basotho (what people from Lesotho are called) who have a desire to share Christ’s love with their own people. Some of the vital roles they play include maintenance specialists, loaders, bookkeepers, and flight followers; and there is even a Basotho MAF chaplain. “It has been really amazing to see how this team of Basotho staff have really grown,” said Bryan. “They are developing in their roles and they make our jobs as pilots easy.”
The team often finds creative ways to work out the logistics of flight plans so that Bryan and the other pilots can respond to medical emergencies—rerouting schedules mid-flight, calculating fuel supplies, and directing them to where they can safely land and refuel from MAF’s remote fuel caches
“By the time they call me,” said Bryan, “they have worked out all the details. I love working with them—it makes flying so much more efficient.” This day was no different.With this baby’s life on the line, local MAF staff members—including Lehlohonolo “Oliphant” Tjokolo, the flight operations manager, and Tebello Ntebe Ntelo, the MAF flight follower—worked quickly to make it possible for Bryan to bring help. Just in TimeFrom Lebakeng, Bryan radioed Tebello at the MAF base in the capital city of Maseru, and she quickly got in touch with the nearby office of the Lesotho Flying Doctor Service. They sent a staff person to the store to buy a box of baby formula. The box was waiting for Bryan in the hangar as soon as he arrived. Oliphant had made arrangements for the plane to be loaded and refueled, and, in no time, Bryan whisked away to Lebakeng and the hungry baby. “If it weren’t for the team on the ground, I would have had to run to the grocery store and back to the hangar, which would have tacked on a lot of time,” said Bryan. “By that point it would have likely been too late to land back in the village with the winds picking up.” Even so, the wind was already beginning to sweep over the mountains as Bryan neared the airstrip.“I prayed earnestly, as the turbulence rocked my aircraft, that I would be able to land,” wrote Bryan in his family’s monthly prayer letter. “I fought that wind all the way to touchdown, but it was well within limits … just another ‘normal’ day in Lesotho!” The formula was safely delivered. By the time Bryan was airborne on the way back to Maseru, he knew the nurses and villagers had worked out a long-term plan to care for the newborn baby.
“I love that I got to be a part of this story,” said Bryan. “But it was really the national staff who were instrumental in this story’s success. I was ‘ops-normal.’ They took the extra step to make sure everything worked out.” “I have seen God’s love through MAF,” said Oliphant. “I feel blessed to be part of MAF Lesotho, where our everyday jobs include saving the lives of the Basotho people in the mountains. I enjoy saving lives.” MAF would not be able to serve well in Lesotho without people like Oliphant and Tebello—nor could MAF share Christ’s love with isolated people around the world without the generous support of people like you who make stories like this possible!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Impact Pool,,Maseru,https://www.impactpool.org/jobs/974987,"The maternal, new-born health and Still birth situation is a concern as the numbers of women who die from pregnancy and childbirth related causes have increased immensely in Lesotho since 1990. The maternal mortality ratio is among the highest in the region, with an estimate of 1,155 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009. The Government of Lesotho has set a target to reduce maternal deaths to 300 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030 but with the present trend this is highly unlikely to be achieved, unless collective efforts are urgently initiated by all relevant ministries under the tutelage of the Ministry of Health, departments, development partners, civil society, and communities.
Globally 2.5 million newborns die in the first days every year and neonatal mortality represents 47% of under-five child deaths. One third of new-born deaths happen on the day of birth. The time of labour and childbirth as well as the first days of life remain the most vulnerable period for many babies across the world.
 Lesotho is no exception to this trend. While the country has made considerable progress in reducing under-5 mortality, maternal and neonatal mortality remains unacceptably high. Neonatal deaths currently represent 50% of all under five deaths, which reduced from 47 per 1000 live births in 2009 to 36 per 1000 live births in 2018. In 2021, UN reports ranked Lesotho with the highest newborn Mortality Rate (NMR) in the Eastern and Southern Africa, at 35 newborn deaths per 1000 live births. This shows that Lesotho is off track for every newborn to survive and thrive goals and to meet SDG3.2. This statistic likely underestimates the actual neonatal mortality rate. Deaths of newborns are often underreported because their deaths occur before birth registration.
Although a lot of progress has been made during the past two decades in coverage of skilled birth attendance in health facilities: however, reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality remains unacceptably slow. More attention and strategic shifts to the quality of care is required, as poor quality of care contributes to morbidity and mortality. Complications of preterm birth, asphyxia, intra-partum perinatal death and neonatal infections account for more than 85% of new-born deaths globally.
improving maternal and newborn health and survival and reducing stillbirth highlights global progress on maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, and stillbirths, as well as country efforts to meet the global targets for all three of these critical challenges. The UN recognises the complexity of addressing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality that not only calls for a strategic and prioritised response, but also the participation of diverse stakeholders based on their mandates and relevance. Therefore, development of an action plan for reduction of maternal and new-born morbidity and mortality is an important step towards drastic improvement of SDG 3.1 in Lesotho. The SDG acceleration framework (SDGAF) will assist in employing evidence-based, low cost, high impact solutions to address the obstacles and impediments in achievement of SDG 3. 1. The SDGAF will further determine priorities within existing strategies and bring together fragmented efforts and resources from various partners and stakeholder to specifically target this off-track SDG.It is against this background that UNICEF is seeking consultancy services to review, update LENAP and write the position paper in employing evidence-based information on utilizing low cost, high impact solutions to address the obstacles and impediments in reducing high Maternal mortality, neonatal mortality and still birth Scope of Work Under the overall supervision of the UNICEF Health Officer and in consultation with CSD Chief, Child health Program manager and other UN agencies the consultant will support the development of SDG Acceleration Framework
Specific Objective: 1. Review the status of implementation of last LENAP, including achievements and challenges and support in updating costed LENAP framework to end preventable maternal and new-born deaths and stillbirths.
2. Compile evidence-based information on utilizing low cost, high impact solutions to address the obstacles and impediments to in reducing high maternal and neonatal mortality to use when writing the Position paper which will be used for advocacy to government and parliament to garner support in SDG acceleration framework.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,8th May 2018,Mohare,https://www.pih.org/article/one-mothers-fear-lesotho-will-my-newborn-also-live-hiv,"Thabo Lerata* was born at 1 p.m. on Jan. 1, 2018, the first baby of the New Year to be delivered at Holy Cross Health Center in the highland district of Mohale’s Hoek, Lesotho.His 36-year-old mother, Mathabo Lerata,* made quite a trip to bring him into the world.  Lerata left their home around 9 a.m. that day—while in the early stages of labor—to begin walking to Holy Cross. The trip would require crossing a broad field atop a plateau, then descending a switchbacking dirt road to the closest paved road, at the bottom of a steep slope. She carried a few belongings as the hot day began.  
January is the heart of summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and the sun can beat down heavily on the high-altitude ridges of Mohale’s Hoek, in Lesotho’s southwest. South Africa entirely surrounds Lesotho, a small, agricultural nation that proudly calls itself the Mountain Kingdom.
Partners In Health (PIH), known in Lesotho as Bo-mphato Litsebeletsong Tsa Bophelo, has worked in the country for more than 12 years. That work significantly expanded in 2014, when PIH began supporting Lesotho’s national health reform, as the primary technical advisor to the Ministry of Health. The reform’s goals include reducing child mortality and mother-to-child transmission of HIV, improving maternal health, and combating HIV and TB, of which Lesotho has some of the world’s highest prevalence rates. PIH and the ministry are piloting the reform in four districts, including Mohale’s Hoek, but the goal is to expand nationwide and ensure that all of Lesotho’s 2.2 million people have access to health care, in the most remote locations.  The Leratas’ one-story home fits that descriptionIt would take Lerata more than an hour to reach the PIH-supported Holy Cross on New Year’s Day. Stepping out her front door, she had views all around of rugged mountains that sometimes resembled the American Southwest. She first crossed the top of the plateau—a wide field strewn with large rocks, patches of dirt, and thin, faded tracks. Lerata later said it can get very windy up there, and very cold in the winter. On clear days, she can see across the nearby border into South Africa. On the other side of the plateau is the village of Ha Mohlekana, a small cluster of homes and buildings near the dirt road that leads down the slope.Lerata makes the walk all the time, as do her 15-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, and said the trip from her door to pavement takes about 30 minutes. That seems optimistic at first glance, but she’s lived there for more than 13 years and says it confidently—30 minutes.From the paved road, it’s usually 30 more minutes by foot to Holy Cross.Unless, of course, you’re pregnant. Or in labor.Lerata said her contractions with Thabo started Dec. 31, but she initially didn’t realize they were contractions, because they felt different than they had with her first two children.Her first two children were born at the district hospital in Mohale’s Hoek, farther away from the family’s home than Holy Cross.The proximity of the health center—relative proximity, at least—was a blessing with her third child.Lerata's village health worker, Malerato Tsoelesa, had visited her at least twice a week since before her pregnancy with Thabo. Tsoelesa regularly checked on the entire family, to accompany Lerata and her children to the PIH-supported Holy Cross for free doctor visits, and then to guide Lerata's prenatal care. In all, Tsoelesa works with seven families around the village. All of them have children.But Tsoelesa wasn’t able to be at Lerata’s home that morning, because things happened so quickly. Lerata’s husband was away in South Africa, working in mines.  The resulting situation was vastly different from labor and childbirth in the U.S.—and most other countries around the world, for that matter. Walking such a distance and in such rugged conditions while in labor, or even late in pregnancy, would be unthinkable.But not in Mohale’s Hoek.Lerata told the story offhandedly six weeks later, sitting in her living room and holding Thabo on her lap. She didn’t say whether she had been alone on the morning he was born, or whether she had taken a taxi from the paved road or just continued walking to the health center.  
Those details didn’t seem to matter all that much.Lerata acknowledged that people often exclaim when she tells the story of that day, but said she shrugs it off, herself, saying the walk wasn’t too bad because her labor started gradually. Besides, as she told the story on the morning of Feb. 13, she had something else on her mind. Thabo was due for his six-week checkup at Holy Cross, which would include a PCR test (the acronym stands for polymerase chain reaction). The test would be held the next day, and Lerata would be able to see the results within about an hour, during the same visit.
The test would be the first indicator of whether Thabo had HIV, like both of his parents.Lerata said her husband learned he was HIV-positive in 2008, and has been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) since about that time. She was diagnosed a year later, and also started ART promptly.
Both of their older children are HIV-negative. Those results and both parents’ commitment to ART meant Thabo’s odds were good, too. But there was still a risk.Dr. Afom Andom, PIH’s lead technical advisor for Lesotho’s national health reform, said that without ART, the risk of pregnant women with HIV passing the virus to their children can reach 40 percent. Transmission can occur in utero, during childbirth and while breastfeeding. Lesotho's Ministry of Health and PIH are taking significant steps to reduce that rate. Andom said a scaled-up HIV program, begun in 2016, has made Lesotho the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to implement widespread screening practices known as “test and treat.” The increased screening and a corresponding emphasis on long-term, sustained ART have combined to reduce mother-to-child transmission to less than 6 percent, across 72 health centers in the reform’s four pilot districts. The goal is to ultimately achieve a rate of less than 2 percent.
Lerata consistently uses Holy Cross for her ART and services for her children—all three of them have received immunizations, checkups and more at the health center.On the morning of Thabo’s six-week checkup and PCR test, Lerata brought him to Holy Cross in a taxi. She said the trip cost 6 South African rand (US$0.50). The rand is commonly used in Lesotho, along with the national currency, the loti.The mood inside Holy Cross that morning was festive. It was Valentine’s Day and several of the nurses were wearing red, some because of the holiday and others just because. Rain began falling against a window as Lerata fed Thabo in a clinic room around 10 a.m. He was fussy and hungry, which his mother described as common. He had been crying, eating and moving around more than his two older siblings had when they were infants.As registered nurse midwife Mamakama Mofolo began the checkup, Thabo soon began crying again.“Phephi, phephi (Sorry, sorry),” Mofolo said softly, as she checked Thabo’s head circumference, bone development, body length and more, moving from head to toe and repeating the Sesotho apology, pronounced like “peppy.”As Thabo fussed, another baby could be heard crying in the hallway. Holy Cross serves more than 11,550 people, from villages throughout the region, and was busy that Wednesday morning.After the checkup, Lerata fed Thabo again, quickly calming him down. Then it was time for his PCR test.Four counselors were waiting in a small room across the hall. Marelebohile Motlomelo, Makanelolo Mahlatsi, Nthabeleng Ichasake and Matseko Mokhamo gave Lerata pre-test counseling, advising her on the procedure and what the results would mean.Motlomelo then leaned forward and made small pricks in one of Thabo’s big toes, drawing a few drops of blood. She used a container that resembled a floppy disk to absorb the sample, then placed the container in the health center’s PCR machine.It’s rare for health centers in Lesotho to have such a machine—most often, samples are sent to district or national labs for analysis. The machine at Holy Cross is supported by multiple aid partners, in response to the high number of infants exposed to HIV in Mohale’s Hoek.Processing Thabo’s results would take about an hour.In the meantime, Lerata brought her son into a larger room at the health center, for immunizations. Several other mothers held infants in the room, sitting in rows of chairs while waiting for shots.When it was Thabo’s turn, Nurse Assistant Mookho Matekane kneeled by their chair and gave him vaccines against polio and pneumococcal conjugate, along with a pentavalent, which combines five vaccines into one shot.Thabo didn’t like the shots, understandably, and began to cry again. It was about 10:50 a.m., less than an hour after he and his mother had arrived at Holy Cross. The healthy, active 6-week-old had had a tough morning.
And it undoubtedly was just as hard for Lerata, as she waited at the health center for PCR results. Infants at risk for HIV also are tested at 14 weeks and at nine months, and then given a definitive test at 18 months, so Thabo’s results that day would be preliminary. But Dr. Andom said the six-week results are a strong early indicator of an infant's status. Changes of that status in later tests are rare. Soon enough, Thabo’s results were ready.Lerata returned to the counseling room, and sat in a chair next to a desk. Motlomelo read the results out loud.HIV-negative, just like his brother and sister.Lerata’s eyes watered, and a smile broke across her face. She laughed and took a deep breath, as the results were written in a register and in Thabo’s bukana, a small book kept by the family that contains a child’s birth information, medicines and health history.All of the counselors smiled as everyone leaned back in their chairs, a morning’s worth of tension palpably erased.“Kea leboha (Thank you),” Lerata said in Sesotho. “Kea leboha.”The rest of their visit passed quickly. Lerata walked outside to the adjacent, one-room HIV facility, where she received a refill of her ART. A large filing cabinet had drawers labeled for active ART patients, pre-ART, and more.Next door, pharmacist Malefetsane Letsosa filled the prescription.Outside, Mary Lesesa, the primary health care coordinator for Mohale’s Hoek, translated more of what Lerata had said in Sesotho after the PCR results were read.“She was a bit frightened,” Lesesa said. “But when the results came out, she was very happy.""That emotion was evident as Lerata prepared to leave the health center. She swept Thabo onto her back, snuggled into a baby carrier, and wrapped him securely there with a large, brown-and-peach blanket.Then Lerata, her 7-year-old son—who had come along that morning—another mother, and Tsoelesa, Lerata’s village health worker, left Holy Cross and proceeded up the road, talking and laughing as they began another long walk home.

UNFPA,August 2013,Leribe,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/saving-lives-our-priority-midwives,"“My biggest fear is seeing a woman leaving the health facility with a box containing a lifeless newborn yet she had come with new clothes for the baby,” says a Midwife at St Denis Clinic in Leribe district, Tlaleng Motaba. She prays every time she supports a woman during labour and the birthing process that the lives of both the mother and the baby would survive.Her advice to other Midwives, in celebration of International Midwifery Day (May 5) is that they should be patient, have compassion and always properly guide the women during labour so that their lives and their babies’ lives would be spared.UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund commemorated this year’s midwifery day under the theme, “Actioning Evidence: Leading the Way to Enhance Quality Midwifery Care Globally.”   For UNFPA, Midwives – and people with midwifery skills – are the main caregivers for women and their newborns during pregnancy, labour, childbirth and in the post-delivery period, therefore, the organization stands in solidarity with midwives worldwide and thank them for the life-saving work they do.As the Fund’s Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem has reaffirmed,“Every year on this day, we celebrate midwives for their unwavering commitment to saving lives and ensuring the health and wellbeing of women and newborn babies.In a world that sees a woman die every two minutes due to pregnancy or childbirth, we also take this moment to champion universal access to skilled midwives as one of the most important ways to avert preventable maternal and newborn deaths,” she has stated.“If every pregnant woman had access to a well-trained, caring midwife, we would be much closer to a world where every childbirth is safe. Instead, many health systems continue to marginalize this mostly female workforce, and treat midwives poorly in terms of pay, working conditions and opportunities to cultivate skills. This, along with a global shortage of 900,000 midwives, reflects an assumption that they are not essential healthcare workers. Nothing could be further from the truth,” she has added.Another Midwife at Ha Lejone Health Centre says her priority is also saving the lives of both the mother and the baby. Ms ‘Malefa Lekhebotsane serves women who come from the remotest areas, who sometimes have to walk for more than three hours to reach the health facility.
To other Midwives in celebration of Midwifery Day she said, “Let us always be patient. We should remember every time what we committed to when we lighted the lamp (Florence Nightingale).”Most of the Midwives have described the joy they get after safely delivering a baby. ”There is nothing as joyful as hearing that first cry,” said a Midwife at Matlameng Health Facility, Thabo Makhakhe. “Recently I delivered a baby with breathing complications. I resuscitated him.....I will never forget the joy I felt when that baby cried,” he stated. Despite the challenges they face, many of the Midwives have said they strive to save mothers and their babies and try by all means to avoid maternal deaths.  In Lesotho, maternal mortality is estimated at 618/100 000 live births (Census 2016).Most mothers are also grateful to Midwives for having assisted and supported them during childbirth. One of the women ‘Matiisetso Taeboso who has three children would not forget when she was in labour with her third child at Kolojane Clinic. “I was vomiting, having complications of  labour and I was very miserable but that Midwife was very supportive. She was with me all the time throughout the process. When she realized that I had to be referred to Mapoteng hospital she used her own vehicle because there was not transport available at the clinic. I cannot thank her enough,” she said.
Midwives save lives. As thus, UNFPA views access to midwives as the single most important factor in stopping the preventable maternal and newborn deaths. UNFPA’s view is that access to midwives is the single most important factor in stopping preventable maternal and newborn deaths.In Lesotho, UNFPA supports the government through the Ministry of Health in advancing the midwifery curriculum and strengthening midwifery services as a strategy of reducing maternal deaths. UNFPA also supports training of midwives, emergency obstetric and neonatal care in efforts to contribute towards ending preventable maternal deaths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNFPA,31 July 2023,,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/peer-educators%E2%80%99-skills-sharpened-efforts-intensified-hiv-prevention,"In an effort to strengthen provision of services and implementation of Along the Borders Comprehensive HIV prevention project, which is financially and technically supported by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, Peer Educators from Lesotho Planned Parenthood Association (LPPA), which implements the project converged in Leribe earlier this year to review program performance and develop an implementation plan for 2023.The Peer Educators were empowered with strategies on how to reach their targets and were also equipped with participatory learning processes, including methods, techniques, activities and exercises that they can deploy as trainers to, among others, attract key populations to uptake Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) services. LPPA is providing key populations integrated sexual reproductive health rights information and services in three borders, Maseru, Maputsoe and Vanroyen. The purpose of this program is to ensure that all target key populations Sex workers, Long Distance Truck Drivers (LDTD) and Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) Community) access and utilize the Key population friendly services to meet their sexual and reproductive health needs along the borders of Maseru, Mafeteng and Maputsoe. which deemed high volume and porous, and also have high migrant populations rendering them catalytic to transmission of new HIV infections.LPPA also engages its trained Mobilizers to educate and mobilize clients for its structured events for uptake of services and information. The Mobilizers are responsible for providing continuous SRHR education and referrals within the project implementation areas (along the borders) on a daily basis to ensure improved HIV prevention and integrated services knowledge and the uptake of SRH services. They work in collaboration with the health clinics based in Maputsoe, Maseru and Mafeteng borders.The training focused mainly on peer education, demand creation good data collection and importance of data quality at every stage of project life cycle and develop their 2023 Work Plans. In addition, the training highlighted and equipped the peer educators to be able to effectively communicate what they have learned to the targeted Key Populations, engage their key pops in conversations about the issues surrounding SRHR, Seek to promote health-enhancing knowledge and skills, Promote health-enhancing behaviour change and Integrate Innovation and digitalization in the projectAlong the Borders Comprehensive HIV Prevention Project is meant to intensify prevention of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) amongst risk populations such as key populations - groups who, due to specific higher-risk behaviours, are at increased risk of HIV, migrants and youth, and improved access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and rights information and services along the three borders.

UNFPA,11th June 2021,,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/high-hiv-prevalence-districts-targeted-hiv-prevention,"UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund is supporting ongoing District Orientation and Capacity Building of District AIDS Committee Members and Councilors, Community Council Secretaries and Journalists in three districts of Lesotho with the highest HIV prevalence, to ensure an effective and efficient coordination and implementation of HIV and AIDS Programmes with a meaningful and high level of stakeholder involvement at the decentralized level.UNFPA is supporting the National AIDS Commission in undertaking the training in Mohale’shoek district, where HIV prevalence is the highest in the country at 29.3%, Quthing which is at 26.5 % and Mokhotlong which is at 26.1%.According to the HIV Coordinator in the Ministry of Local Government, Mr Malefetsane Nkhabu, the aim is for the three districts to effectively perform duties mandated to them – decentralizing response coordination on HIV and AIDS in local government structures.
 “We want them to understand the situation around them,” he has said adding that they are also capacitated on the five HIV prevention pillars; Combination prevention for adolescent girls, young women and their male in high-prevalence locations; Combination prevention for key populations; Comprehensive condom programming; Voluntary medical male circumcision and sexual and reproductive health services for men and boys and initiation to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis.He added that participants are also being familiarised with the gateway approach which places the local authorities in the forefront of the fight and prevention of HIV and AIDS, while also linking it with community services -putting services at the centre of the response and also aligning with the National Strategic Plan to ensure that 40% of the response is at community level.After the training, they are expected to prioritise plans on the impacts and needs of the communities following services brought by different service providers available in the districts.Speaking about the impact of COVID19, he has lamented lack of the necessary data due to the inability to track activities happening around the communities as Service Providers are not able to perform effectively as they are at the risk of impeding the COVID19 protocols adding also the inability to regularly meet the District AIDS Committees and as thus hindering the process of operationalising work plans.One of the Councillors from Ha Khoelenya , Mekaling in the Mohale’shoek district Mrs ‘Maseetsa Majara finds the training as important, “because it is empowering us and we are going to share the information with those in our communities. I believe this will be one of the ways to ensure that we have good health as the Basotho nation.”The Councillor, who is also a member of the Mohale’shoek Social Services District Committee believes Lesotho will reach the set 2030 agenda goals which she heard about for the first time during the workshop.What she sees as a setback though, is that in Mohale’shoek there is a lot of entertainment areas where intergenerational sex is rife putting young people at the risk of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and infections to HIV.She therefore encourages vigorous promotion and distribution of condoms and education especially to young people.A Journalist working for Bokamoso FM who also participated in the training Matseliso Sekake Makibi, was optimistic, saying the fact that Lesotho has reached the 90 90 90 targets means that the country will also reach the 95 95 95 targets.“Journalistically, I now know I have reliable sources of information in the District AIDS Committees and where I can get them.  As a Journalist who is going to focus on HIV prevention, I am going to call in people who will talk about issues related to HIV prevention in my radio program. I am now knowledgeable and I will be able to ask the right questions,” she has said, adding that the workshop has motivated her.For UNFPA, the approach to HIV is based around three strategies: promoting human rights and reducing inequalities, integrating HIV responses into sexual and reproductive health care, and preventing sexual transmission of HIV.UNFPA in Lesotho is also supporting a comprehensive HIV prevention project called “Along the borders,” which focuses on preventing HIV transmission and improved access to Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights information and services along Lesotho’s three porous borders of Maseru, Maputsoe and Mafeteng. These are the busiest borders which are deemed highly porous and catalytic to transmission of new HIV infections, hence the project is targeting migrants, long distance truck drivers, youth and key populations along these borders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medicines Sans Frontireers ,5th June 2013,,https://www.msf.org/lesotho-maternal-mortality-mountain-kingdom,"Imagine you are nine months pregnant, ready to give birth. You feel your contractions start. You are excited and afraid at the same time but mostly you are in pain and you pray that everything will go well. Now imagine it will take you two, three, four hours or longer, to reach the nearest health facility where you can get an assisted delivery. Imagine mountainous terrain and a journey mostly on foot.What sounds like anyone’s worst nightmare is a reality for many women in Lesotho. Mantebaleng Ntelekoa, a young mother from a rural area in the Lesotho mountains, remembers: “For all of my three deliveries, I walked two hours to the main road and then continued by minibus to the hospital.“I usually started walking when my contractions started and it took a long time, because I had to sit down every time I had a contraction. One of my children was born premature at seven months, so I am glad I made it to the hospital.” But not everyone is as lucky as Mantebaleng. High numbers of people with HIV and poor access to maternity services has lead Lesotho to suffer one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world at 620 deaths per 100,000 live births – representing about twice the global average.More than 50 percent of those deaths are attributed to HIV-related complications. The government of Lesotho has set a target to reduce maternal deaths to 300 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015, and is working on an accelerated action plan to reach the far-off Millennium Development Goal for Maternal Health.Yet, at present, the health situation for many expectant mothers in the small southern African mountain kingdom remains uncertain.Mortality rates in very rural and isolated areas are particularly high. Long distances to the nearest health centre, lack of transport, often impassable terrain in the winter season, as well as user fees charged at major hospitals keep many women from accessing antenatal care, lifesaving HIV treatments as well as services for the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV.The Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) team in Lesotho is supporting rural health facilities to ensure that more women from remote areas have access to antenatal services and safe deliveries.A doctor, a midwife and several nurses are supporting health facilities in 10 different locations across the districts of Roma and Semonkong.At St Leonard clinic in Semonkong, there is a small maternity ward and a mothers’ waiting lodge, allowing expecting mothers to come there close to their due date, ensuring they will be able to deliver their babies with the assistance of a trained midwife. New mothers may then stay after giving birth until they are ready to return home with their newborn. “I sleep in the waiting lodge with the mothers when I am in Semonkong, and the atmosphere is quite amazing,” says MSF midwife Marleen Dermaut. “There is a lot of chatting and giggling, the women feel safe and enjoy each others’ company.“After all, they are all in the same position, experiencing the wonder of new life and, away from their duties for a couple of days, are being able to just focusing on themselves and their new babies.”On average, there are six women at the facility at all times. Since last year, the number of assisted deliveries at St Leonard almost tripled from seven to 20 deliveries per month. Likely, this is due to a combination of increased health promotion by health centre staff in the area and MSF’s donation of an ambulance.“The ambulance takes women to the hospital in case of emergencies during labour or after delivery. The hospital is still a two-hour drive away from St Leonard, which can be a long time in an emergency situation. In fact, it already happened that a baby was born in the ambulance,” says Dermaut.Additionally to the specific support of maternity services in Lesotho, a team of MSF health promoters is going out into communities regularly to test people for HIV and tuberculosis (TB) and to improve health education in remote areas.In places with high rates of HIV and TB, this first step is crucial so people understand how to spot the diseases, test for them and be able to start treatment right away if necessary. To reach as many people as possible and to directly involve people living in these areas, MSF trains lay people in communities or “community health workers,” how to test for HIV and when to refer community members to a health facility.“The motivation of many people we work with, be it nurses or community counsellors, and the willingness to make changes definitely makes my work here even more rewarding,” says Dermaut.YOU COULD ALSO BE INTERESTED IN",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social Responsibility Network,2019,,https://wsr-network.org/success-stories/gender-justice-in-lesotho-apparel/,"Launched in 2019, the “Agreements to Prevent and Combat Gender-Based Violence and Harassment in Lesotho” are making great progress towards their goals of addressing sexual harassment and gender-based violence in the Lesotho-based suppliers of several major apparel brands.This historic binding agreement has been a tremendous accomplishment for Lesotho garment workers, who, though their unions, are ending the pervasive abuses in garment factories The program’s success to date also shows the adaptability and scalability of the Worker-driven Social Responsibility model, which continues to prove just how effective it is at protecting workers’ fundamental human rights in global supply chains spanning three continents and multiple industries. The Lesotho agreement covers five factories and benefits more than 10,000 apparel workers, the vast majority of whom are women. The agreement establishes that:Any worker who experiences harassment or coercion has the right to file a complaint with the independent monitoring body Workers’ Rights Watch, which will investigate the complaint and impose remedies. Such remedies can include requiring the employer to terminate the abuser – an action that would have been practically unheard of in the global apparel industry prior to this agreement;Robust anti-retaliation provisions to ensure that complainants and witnesses are protected;An in-depth training program for workers about their rights under the program. Workers are compensated by their employer for the time they spend in these trainings;Strong protections against any interference with, or retaliation against, workers’ exercise of their associational rights; and Many other provisions as outlined in the announcement here. Unlike the voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSRs) programs and multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) that are often used to deflect public scrutiny of abuses, this binding agreement includes strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the employer and the buyers comply with their commitments. In the case of the brands, they can be subject to legal action for violating the program’s terms. In the case of the employer, Nien Hsing faces a potential loss of business if it fails to uphold the agreement. As demonstrated in other WSR programs, such consequences are critical to ensuring that workplace improvements are implemented and maintained over time. This program was developed in the face of overwhelming odds, as workers at the Nien Hsing Textile Co. in Lesotho came together to demand respect and justice in the workplace, and an end to a pervasive environment of gender-based violence. The agreement would not have come about without years of courageous organizing by the three unions representing garment workers at the supplier, Nien Hsing Textile: the Independent Democratic Union of Lesotho (IDUL), the United Textile Employees (UNITE), and the National Clothing Textile and Allied Workers Union (NACTWU). Equally important in achieving these agreements were the Federation of Women Lawyers in Lesotho (FIDA) and Women and Law in Southern African Research and Education Trust-Lesotho (WLSA), two of Lesotho’s leading women’s rights advocates. WLSA and FIDA joined with the three unions to battle workplace harassment and abuse at the factories. The unions helped the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) document and expose the reality in the factories, through an intensive investigation. The WRC recommended that the unions and women’s groups join forces to pursue a WSR agreement with the factory’s three main buyers and then pressed the buyers, Levi’s, The Children’s Place, and Kontoor Brands, to come to the table. WRC, the Solidarity Center, and Workers United then worked side-by-side with the Lesotho union and women’s rights leaders to negotiate with the brands and Nien Hsing. Throughout, FIDA’s and WLSA’s insights were indispensable in the design of the anti-sexual harassment program the new agreements will create. The complaint mechanism outlined in the agreement and implemented by Workers’ Rights Watch was modeled after the one in the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ (CIW) Fair Food Program, an initiative that has been uniquely successful in addressing a culture of sexual harassment and gender-based violence that had persisted for years in the US agricultural industry. The program also draws from the experience of the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry which has transformed safety conditions and dramatically reduced workplace hazards for more than two million garment workers in Bangladesh and is now expanding to Pakistan. 
The Fair Food Standards Council (FFSC) and CIW shared expertise and protocols, and provided strategic advice and support during the process, which included a two-day exchange in Immokalee, Florida between representatives from the organizations in Lesotho, CIW, FFSC, WRC, Solidarity Center, and WSR Network. The development of the Lesotho Agreement underscores the adaptability of the WSR model and the infrastructure and support that exist for its expansion. It is more clear than ever that the biggest obstacle that exists for expansion of the model is brands’ unwillingness to sign binding agreements and commit to meaningful action, not a failure of the WSR model. 
This is the second example of a WSR program in the global apparel industry, following the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, which the WRC and two other Network members, Clean Clothes Campaign and the International Labor Rights Forum, helped to create and implement. The Solidarity Center is taking the lead in upporting the Lesotho organizations on program implementation with support from the WRC. FFSC is providing advice and consultation, particularly on implementation of the agreement’s complaint mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
News Day,August 15th 2022,,https://www.newsdayonline.co.ls/rape-scourge-haunts-lesotho/,"The Lesotho Mounted Police Services (LMPS) have recorded an alarming 845 cases of sexual assault incidents in the country since January 2022. 48 more cases increase from that recorded last year around the same time.According to the LMPS crime statistics, Qacha’s Nek has more cases of sexual assault with perpetrators being mostly people close to the victims.Just this week, the LMPS reported 5 cases of sexual assault cases in their weekly crime reports with one being a 74-year old woman who was raped by a 62-year old intruder who broke into her house in Qacha’s Nek.Reports also told of a 13-year old girl who was raped by her 19-year old brother. On a similar case, a 15-year old was also raped by her mother’s 40-year old boyfriend. Reports show that this man had been raping the girl since she was 12. The case came into light because the victim is currently five months pregnant.These are the few cases of a hundred others which the police report of weekly, further proving that sexual offences are serious crime in Lesotho which the government should look deeper into. There is a range of crimes that are considered sexual offences, including non-consensual crimes such as rape or sexual assault, crimes against children including child sexual abuse or grooming, and crimes that exploit others for a sexual purpose.Sexual offence crimes can occur between strangers, friends, acquaintances, current or ex-partners, or family members. Some studies have indicated that women are four times more likely than men to experience sexual assault or unwanted touching.In August 2019, a survey by the Workers’ Rights Consortium (WRC) revealed that sexual abuse of women was rampant in Lesotho textiles factories owned by Nien Hsing, a supplier for Levi Strauss and other brands in the United States of America. The WRC is an independent labour rights monitoring organisation based in the United States. It investigates working conditions in factories around the world to identify and expose the practices of global brands and retailers “that perpetuate labour rights abuses”. The survey found that nearly two-thirds of women from three factories who were interviewed reported “having experienced sexual harassment or abuse” or having knowledge of harassment or abuse suffered by co-workers. Women from all three factories surveyed identified Gender-Based Violence and Harassment (GBVH) as a central concern for themselves and other female employees. Then in September last year, a Commonwealth study revealed violence against women and girls costs Lesotho more than $113 million (about M1.9 billion) a year. The study estimated the total cost, including loss of income and expenses associated with medical, legal and police support, equated to around 5.5 percent of Lesotho’s gross domestic product (GDP). The cost of $113 million meant each Lesotho citizen loses at least $50 (about M730) every year to violence against women and girls. The bulk – $45 million – was attributed to legal protection, healthcare, social services and learning loss. This is more than twice the amount – $21 million – Lesotho spent on health, education and energy in the 2019/2020 fiscal year. “Due to COVID-19, there were lockdowns where we had to spend most of our time with our spouses and children. This put them in danger of abuse. That when we heard about increased cases of rape and killings of women and girls by males,” said Prime Minister Dr Moeketsi Majoro following the publication of the Commonwealth report. “To you my fellow men and boys of Lesotho, where is the protection of this country and its people that has been culturally entrusted to you? Why have you abandoned that responsibility? I appeal to you to take the responsibility of protecting the country and Basotho,” Majoro added. He was speaking at the National Prayer against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) event at ‘Manthabiseng Convention Centre in Maseru in December 2020. The event was part of Lesotho’s commemorations of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence which started on November 25, and ended on December 10, 2020. The most recent crimes statistics report by the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) revealed that 1,419 sexual offence cases were reported across the country from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, but does not consider any actions taken thereafter. Sexual offence cases constituted 11.7 percent of all serious crimes reported last year. The report read: “Of all the 12,144 reported serious crime cases, housebreaking, stock theft, sexual offence and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm cases constituted the highest reported cases of serious crimes in 2020.” In 2019, out of the 13,263 serious crimes reported, 1.449 were cases of sexual assault. This represents a meagre 2.07 percent decrease. Qacha’s Nek’s Superintendent Thembinkosi Sibanda said men should repent and refrain from raping women and children and start protecting them. He said parents should also teach their children to protect each other and spend more time with their children so that they become aware when something is not right. “Parents should also refrain from being drunk at all times to avoid their children being abused in their presence. The public should also report rape incidents to the police if there are any suspicions of such or signs from a child.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lesotho times,May 18th 2021,Southern Africa,https://lestimes.com/sexual-abuse-at-factories/,"EMPLOYEES at a garment factory in Lesotho, a tiny country in southern Africa, say they have lived in constant fear for years. Each day at 7 a.m., as their sewing machines whirred, a familiar panic rose in many of them: It’s not safe here. At least 38 current workers say abuse and harassment are taking place within the walls of Hippo Knitting, a Taiwanese company located in Lesotho’s capital, Maseru, an investigation by TIME and The Fuller Project has found. All employees interviewed asked to remain anonymous out of safety concerns and fear of losing their jobs. The factory predominantly supplies one brand: Fabletics, a popular US athletic apparel line co-founded by actor Kate Hudson. Thirteen women interviewed say their underwear and vulvas are often exposed during routine daily searches by supervisors. Another woman says a male supervisor tried to pressure her into a sexual relationship, while three women allege male supervisors sexually assaulted them. Several of those workers added they are often humiliated and verbally abused by management. Workers say they are forced to crawl on the floor by one supervisor as a punishment. In one recent instance, a woman says she urinated on herself because the same supervisor prevented her from accessing the bathroom. After TIME and The Fuller Project reached out to Fabletics on April 29 for comment on the alleged abuse at Hippo Knitting, the brand vowed to do “everything in (their) power to further remedy the situation,” according to a spokesperson. “We have immediately suspended all operations with Hippo Knitting, with a site visit and interviews beginning as soon as possible under current COVID-19 restrictions,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “The top priority for Fabletics is the workers who are impacted, and we are committed to providing their full pay during the course of the investigation.” A representative for Kate Hudson said she had no knowledge of the reports before TIME and The Fuller Project reached out, and that “Fabletics management attested to Kate that they maintain the highest ethical and social standards in their factories and workplaces and have commenced a full and comprehensive investigation.” Many workers say they’ve been working under these conditions for years. Now, they and Lesotho-based unions are concerned that roughly 1000 workers could lose their jobs if Fabletics pulls their business from the factory. “We are tired, we need help, we work with bleeding hearts,” says a woman who has worked at the factory for a decade. In the ‘80s, Taiwanese and South African companies set up some of the first garment factories in Lesotho, a landlocked country encircled by South Africa. They were drawn by its low labour costs, favourable tax benefits, and access to both the southern African and international markets. When then-President Bill Clinton signed a trade deal called the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2000, allowing duty-free exports to the U.S., the industry boomed. In the four years after, the number of people employed in the sector jumped to 54 000 workers—a 260 percent increase—according to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Trade Hub. Today, the thriving garment industry is Lesotho’s second-largest employer, and its workers, an estimated 90 percent of whom are women, craft clothes for some of America’s most prominent brands: Levi Strauss, Wrangler, JCPenney and Walmart. The U.S. is the largest recipient of Lesotho’s garment exports, worth US$303 million in 2019, according to USAID Trade Hub. While the country is known for specialising in denim, the largest part of its apparel industry is dedicated to knit garments: T-shirts, tracksuits and sportswear, such as Fabletics’ fast-fashion leggings that sell for US$50 a pop. In a country with persistently high unemployment rates, a steady decline in opportunities for men in the South African mining sector coincided with increased employment for women in Lesotho’s garment industry, and women are now often the breadwinners of their households. Most of the Hippo Knitting employees interviewed were paid roughly $150 per month. “I hate my job, but I cannot leave because there is nowhere else,” says one female employee at Hippo Knitting. Two years ago, a report by Workers Rights Consortium, a U.S.-based NGO, revealed widespread rape, sexual harassment and assault at three factories in Lesotho. The Taiwanese company that owns the factories, Nien Hsing, and the three U.S. brands that produce there—Levi’s, the Children’s Place and Kontoor Brands (owners of Wrangler and Lee)—then signed what’s referred to as the Lesotho Agreement in a bid to protect workers from gender-based violence. As a result, employees must now attend training led by the unions and women’s-rights groups. An independent body, with authority to dismiss perpetrators, was also set up to investigate complaints of harassment by supervisors and managers at the factories. At the time, three U.S. brands said they believed the program could “create lasting change” and that they were committed to making female workers feel “valued and empowered.” Female employees have since said the Nien Hsing factories feel safer. But there are roughly 50 more factories across the country, including Hippo Knitting, where rights groups fear abuse goes unchecked. Meanwhile, the government in Lesotho has only offered a tepid response to the issue. Over the course of 40 interviews, seamstresses, cutters and cleaners employed at Hippo Knitting factory allege verbal abuse and harassment have been rife for years. But several say the unwanted touching during daily searches has worsened during the pandemic because different supervisors are now in charge. At least 11 of the incidents detailed by employees in interviews have been independently verified with unions in Lesotho, family members or friends, and fellow workers in the factory. TIME and The Fuller Project have not been able to independently verify all of the workers’ claims, but several Lesotho-based unions say their stories are common—and reveal a wider pattern of abuse across the garment industry. Each weekday, many of Hippo Knitting’s workers set off on foot before dawn from nearby villages to arrive at the factory gate on time. Of the 1,000 factory employees, roughly 90 percent are women, according to Grace Lin, who owns Hippo Knitting.Workers have long worn masks to protect against fabric dust. Since the pandemic, management has introduced safety measures, including disinfecting the factory every couple of weeks and setting up hand-sanitizing stations, though workers point out that social distancing is nonexistent and windows are frequently closed, causing concern about poor air circulation. While Lesotho has only recorded a total of 318 COVID-19 deaths, it saw rising cases earlier this year. Sewage from a septic tank spews onto the factory yard floor, where employees eat their lunch every day, workers say. “The stench is horrible,” says one seamstress, “we breathe it (in) all day.” At lunch and shortly after workers clock out at 5 pm, supervisors conduct routine body searches as staff exit the building, checking for stolen items with little privacy. “A supervisor pulled my jeans down, pulled my tights elastic toward her and let go … it slapped my (fibroids) operation wound. I was in so much pain,” says one female employee. “She has done this to numerous women … and told several that they don’t shave their private parts.” At least three workers in the factory independently mentioned that they witnessed the operation wound incident during their interviews with TIME and The Fuller Project. Another female employee says she experienced almost daily harassment from a male supervisor for six months. Halfway through 2020, she says her male supervisor started remarking on the way she looked. “He made comments about my weight, that I have a beautiful body … the things he would do to me if he got the chance,” she says over the phone, her voice matter-of-fact. When she refused to engage in a sexual relationship, he “started trying to make my work hell,” assigning her increasingly difficult sewing styles, she says. After she reported his behaviour to the factory’s HR department, he was moved to another production line. She says she feels safer now but is concerned the issue has not been dealt with properly. “Many women have gone through this; it is not just me,” she says. When asked about the male supervisor’s behaviour toward women, another female employee who has worked at the factory for over a decade said it was common knowledge. “Everyone knows (about him),” she says. TIME and The Fuller Project spoke with three women who say they have been sexually assaulted by male supervisors, including incidents where supervisors grabbed the workers’ genitals and repeatedly smacked them on the buttocks. “Most of the factories (across Lesotho) have sexual harassment,” says Tšepang Makakole, deputy general secretary of Lesotho’s National Clothing Textile and Allied Workers Union (NACTWU), which represents more than 4,000 workers. “But people are afraid to lose their jobs.” Makakole noted the landmark Lesotho Agreement gave workers at the Nien Hsing factories the confidence to report harassment issues to NACTWU. But without this system in place at other factories or among other employers, he fears workers are staying silent. “If the factory doesn’t have (the Lesotho Agreement in place) … that’s the problem,” he says. “People know if they speak up it won’t be easy for them.” Co-founded by Hudson in 2013, Fabletics began as an online brand selling what they describe as accessibly priced workout wear. With her partners Adam Goldenberg and Don Ressler, the trio saw a gap in the market for high-quality clothes that “you could perform in” but that were “cute, fashionable and affordable,” Hudson told the Daily Front Row, a fashion industry publication, in 2019. 
With the help of Hudson’s star power, Fabletics took off. More than 1 million orders were shipped in the first six months, making it one of the “fastest-growing fashion brands in history,” according to Fabletics’ parent company, TechStyle Fashion Group (formerly JustFab Inc.). Four years ago, Hudson said onstage at the Fast Company Innovation Festival that she believes Fabletics’ subscription model was the key to its success. Shoppers can opt to pay a monthly $49.95 fee in exchange for access to “VIP Member” prices (such as 50 percent off) to receive new gym wear through the mail. All brands under the TechStyle umbrella—including ShoeDazzle, co-founded by Kim Kardashian, and singer Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty—rely heavily on subscription memberships. Over the years, customers have accused both Fabletics and TechStyle of scamming shoppers into unknowingly signing up for recurring monthly fees that are difficult to cancel. Amid criticism, in 2016, Fabletics vowed to make membership fees clearer though customers still regularly take to social media to decry the brand’s hidden costs. Meanwhile, Fabletics has been hailed a retail success story, expanding quickly across Europe, Australia and Canada, and into more than 50 U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. In 2019, it raked in more than $400 million in annual sales. Celebrities such as singer Kelly Rowland are regularly enlisted to collaborate on limited collections. Last year, comedian Kevin Hart became an investor and face of Fabletics Men, an extension of the women’s line, and has since curated a dual-gender collection with his wife Eniko for the brand. Neither Rowland nor the Harts responded to multiple requests for comment. On social media, the message from both Fabletics and Hudson is one of inclusivity, empowerment and sunny Californian confidence mixed with social justice. “When women rise, we all rise,” reads one Instagram caption on March 8, International Women’s Day, this year. After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May, the brand committed to eradicating “racism, racial inequality and racial injustice.” On her own Instagram page, Hudson wrote: “(We) invite you to stand with us, in solidarity with the Black community. Let’s make a real difference—together.” In an emailed statement, the Fabletics spokesperson described the allegations as “incredibly disturbing” and that they “go against everything that we stand for.” The brand has opened an investigation into the claims, and moved up a previously scheduled third-party audit of the factory. Three workers confirmed production at Hippo Knitting stopped on May 3, after TIME and The Fuller Project raised the allegations, and the factory owner is also investigating. The fast-fashion industry has long relied on the exploitation of garment workers, who are predominantly women of colour, to quickly produce low-cost clothing, and as Fabletics expands, women working thousands of miles away in unsafe environments have been bearing the burden. Rights groups say some brands maximize their own profits while often turning a blind eye to unpaid overtime and subpar human-rights standards. “Global brands have long outsourced their responsibility,” says Mirjam van Heugten of the Clean Clothes Campaign, an Amsterdam-based alliance of labour unions and nongovernmental organisations. “The demand for fast fashion falls backward down the supply chain to these women, who are put under immense pressure with little protection.” At Hippo Knitting, supervisors shout and pile on the pressure to hit their targets, say workers. One employee says they are given “loads” that are “not humanly possible.” Women are arranged in sewing lines of roughly 30 and are pushed to complete up to 1,400 garments each day. If they miss the target, workers say management often forces them to stay beyond 5 p.m. without pay, violating Lesotho’s labour laws, which stipulate a 45-hour workweek limit. Across the industry, government enforcement of laws to protect workers from gender-based violence is also notoriously weak, say rights groups. In the 1990s, retail giants like Nike were plagued by reports of workers paid less than US$2 a day, and subsequently pledged to end child labour. Following the international outcry, fashion brands began to carry out voluntary social audits. Now, across the industry, brand representatives or independent third-party auditors will visit factories to ensure their suppliers are adhering to various labour, environmental and social standards, such as fire safety and workplace discrimination. Factories that supply products for TechStyle and its affiliated brands, such as Fabletics, are contractually obliged to honour their “Ethical Sourcing Code,” which includes compliance with working hours, and prohibits discrimination and harsh and inhumane treatment of workers. To evaluate this, TechStyle says it “subjects its suppliers” to “random unannounced” audits. In an emailed response to the allegations, Lin, the owner of Hippo Knitting, confirmed annual audits are conducted at the factory, the most recent taking place last month. But workers say management pressures them not to tell auditors the truth and threatens that they will lose their job if they do. That comports with the warnings by advocates, who have long called voluntary inspections merely a box-ticking exercise designed to give brands deniability if problems later emerge. When asked about audits in Lesotho, Solong Senohe, general secretary of United Textile Employees (UNITE), another large union, said they are mostly ineffective and sometimes misused. There is an obvious abuse of power inside the factory, says Marorisang Letseka, senior organiser at the Independent Democratic Union of Lesotho (IDUL). “The employees are hesitant to report the sexual and physical abuse as it often amounts to no action against the managers, and results in the worker being attacked to a point of wanting out of the job.” The grey walls inside the men’s bathroom at Hippo Knitting are chipped and cracked, the floor punched with pockets of black dirt. Early one afternoon last year, a male employee was patiently waiting his turn to use the urinal, he says, when the female HR manager, Ellis Tseka, entered. She “pressed” him against the toilet door and “reached” for his zipper to try and touch his genitals, he says. “I was angry,” he says over the phone. “I was so embarrassed by that lady. Why did she do that to me?” In interviews with workers, many issues revolve around Tseka. She is both verbally and sexually abusive, says Letseka from IDUL. She is often present when harassment occurs and takes no action, despite involvement from the unions, according to IDUL. Many workers say they report incidents of abuse from other staff members to her, but very little changes. The male employee reported the toilet incident to his union later that day, which advised him to take the matter to the labour court. “It’s like I’m in jail,” he says, referring to his workplace. “I have no right to say anything to anybody here.” A female employee says Tseka forced her to crawl along the factory floor as punishment for being late. “I had an injury on my knees, and they were inflamed,” the employee says. “I cried the whole time, as I was in pain.” She told her daughter about the incident, who confirmed to TIME and The Fuller Project that her mother’s knees were swollen when she arrived home from work that day last year. Unions and employees say practices inside the factory are also substandard. One female employee says she was made to operate heavy machinery late into her pregnancy, and that Tseka demanded to see a marriage certificate before giving her maternity pay. As the worker was unmarried, her child’s surname was different to hers. In order to obtain the right documentation, she married her partner. TIME and The Fuller Project spoke to the worker’s husband, who confirmed his wife told him a marriage certificate was needed, and have viewed the paperwork she produced for Tseka. Of all the sexual and verbal harassment taking place inside the factory, many workers say Tseka’s behaviour is the most damaging. The one person who should provide a safety net is failing them, they say. “She is supposed to protect us,” says one female employee, “but if you go to her, you will come back even in more pain.” 
In an emailed statement, Lin, the owner of Hippo Knitting, said she is “committed to addressing (the allegations) with the seriousness they deserve” and has “initiated a process of engaging an independent international auditor to establish the credibility and basis of these allegations.” Tseka is now on administrative leave “until we have confirmed findings on the situation,” Lin said, adding that she is talking with the unions to “work on a plan of action with clear timelines and deliverables to ensure that all these issues are addressed adequately.” IDUL confirmed they’re already in the process of drafting an agreement with the factory owners to help ensure safe working conditions. Fabletics pulling out would jeopardise this, they say, and risk significant job loss. For many on the ground, one viable option to help curb gender-based violence at garment factories would be to extend the new Lesotho Agreement across the entire industry. While the pandemic caused a delay in setting up certain components of the program, 200 employees and 40 supervisors have attended training workshops, and the independent body has received two complaints since becoming fully operational in February of this year. “I’ve been asked, even by (members of) the public, Why is the project only at Nien Hsing?” says Senohe from UNITE. “It should cover the whole industry, not only certain companies. Women at Hippo Knitting also want protection.” Even though many Hippo workers were unfamiliar with the recent changes at Nien Hsing, they say they’ve had enough of living in fear inside their own factory. Meanwhile, in the U.S, as a pandemic-pummelled retail industry lies in tatters, Fabletics has announced it’s expanding into 24 more stores across the country and launching a new fitness app. While the brand’s success is yet to translate into safer working conditions in Lesotho, workers are hopeful change is on the horizon. “We need to be treated like human beings and not animals,” says one female Hippo Knitting employee. “We need to feel free.” — Time Magazine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Los Angels Cimes,December 8th 2017,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-harrell-lesotho-metoo-sexual-violence-20171208-story.html,"On my first day in Lesotho — a hardscrabble, high-altitude kingdom in sub-Saharan Africa — the security guard at my government-run lodgings shook my hand and held on too long. After several awkward seconds, I clumsily took my hand back. Later that night, around 10 p.m., I awoke to someone rattling the door handle of my rondavel — a round stone hut with a thatched roof. I reached for my heavy Nikon preparing to defend myself but, luckily, the door stayed locked. Every hour or so after that, I heard someone pacing outside. In the morning, I reported the incidents. “It was probably the security guard,” a female employee suggested. When I asked that the guard be disciplined, the woman looked away and said nothing. Lesotho, too, I thought. The epidemic of sexual violence against women in Lesotho, a nation of 2.2 million people, is arguably the worst in the world. But it is rarely reported. I spent three weeks in the country, dodging unwanted advances and hearing stories of frequent, unpunished sexual assaults. It was the most threatening environment for women that I had ever navigated. If somehow you still don’t recognize the sweeping scale of sexual assault, if you think women across the world don’t need to fight for each other with everything we have, try visiting Lesotho, where holding a man accountable for sexual violence is almost impossible. 
In my work as a guidebook author, Lesotho certainly isn’t the only place I’ve dealt with sexual aggression. In Bali, men asked me to pose for photos and grabbed me close. In the Dominican Republic, I couldn’t stroll in the capital without being hissed at. In San Jose, Costa Rica, a man approached me in a residential neighborhood, smacked my butt and ran. I shrugged it all off, preferring to think of these men as worthless outliers. In retrospect — and especially after what I discovered in Lesotho — this was wildly optimistic. The epidemic of sexual violence against women in this nation of 2.2 million people is arguably the worst in the world, but it is rarely reported. The problem, women’s rights advocates say, begins in childhood. Girls are taught to be compliant, to quietly endure suffering and to serve men. The director of a local aid organization told me grown men regularly flirt with her 8-year-old daughter in the grocery store, capitalizing early on a grossly unequal power dynamic. UNICEF found that 19% of girls under 18 in Lesotho are forced into (illegal) marriages, oftentimes with older men. The rate of new HIV infections is the highest in the world (one in four people have the disease) thanks in no small part to a virtual army of Harvey Weinsteins preying on economically disadvantaged young women. In response to questionnaires circulated by Catholic Relief Services in Lesotho, women have reported that in school, teachers request sex from female students in return for passing grades. At garment factories, security guards require women seeking jobs to have sex before entering the building. Inside, bosses want sex in exchange for hiring women and offering them overtime (which women need to obtain food for children they raise alone because the fathers are often out committing sexual abuse). Marriage offers little protection, as husbands feel free to demand sex at home whenever they please. Women rarely discuss or report any of these encounters. The subject of sex is taboo, and aggressors are unlikely to face consequences. Women who do report sexual abuse risk retaliation. Police are routinely the culprits and even those who are not may be nonchalant about sex crimes. Cases are delayed or dismissed with petty excuses. One aid worker told me police failed to prosecute the rape of a 5-year-old girl because the perpetrator said he was sorry. Lerato Seema, a project manager with the Lesotho Federation of Women Lawyers, says that police tend to treat offenses as “domestic issues” that “they’ll just try to mediate.” On my fifth day in Lesotho, my car got stuck on a mountain road. After a few minutes, a group of four women came walking from a nearby village and stood quietly beside the car. When I asked what they were doing, one explained that it wasn’t safe for me there because “herd boys are silly.” She said this without emotion, her voice a low monotone, and I understood what was to her a simple fact of life: If I were alone there, shepherds might rape me. “Many girls and young women assume that this is just the way things are,” Erica Dahl-Bredine, the Lesotho representative for CRS, told me. “They’ve told us: ‘Boys and men are just like that; they cannot control themselves. They treat women as they wish and we have to accept it.’” There are efforts underway to change the culture of Lesotho: awareness campaigns about the laws, a CRS program called DREAMS that helps girls fight oppression with communication skills and financial literacy, another run by a children’s aid group, Sepheo, and called Khotatsong (“Courageous” in Sesotho, the national language), which aims to redirect the strength of men toward protecting women. Those efforts are certainly noble. But until women speak up and demand to live free from sexual aggression in Lesotho and every other country in the world — and until predators are held to account — they will remain at our doorways, testing the knob. On one of my last nights in Lesotho, a hotel manager held my hand too long. I understood more quickly this time, and I pulled it back as hard as I could.

Afro Barometer,31st August 2022,,https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/ad546-in-lesotho-gender-based-violence-tops-the-list-of-womens-rights-issues-to-be-addressed/,"Gender-based violence (GBV) is a reality for many women in Lesotho. The Police Child and Gender Protection Unit reports that from January through July 2022, there have been 184 sexual offences and 45 assault cases perpetrated against women. In 2021, at least 47% of women murdered in Lesotho were killed by their intimate partners (Mongoshi, 2021). GBV is a serious threat to the nation both developmentally and economically, recognised as one of the drivers of HIV in a country that has the third-highest prevalence rate in the world at 23.2% (UNAIDS, 2021). The Gender-Based Violence Indicators Study by Gender Links (2015) reported that 86% of women and 40% of men in Lesotho experienced some form of violence in their lifetime, and that a majority of victims do not report the violence to the police or seek medical attention or legal recourse. Among barriers to reporting, the study identified survivor stigmatisation by the community, feelings of shame, inadequate police response to victims, and the belief that domestic violence is a private matter not to be discussed with strangers. A study by the Commonwealth (2020) reported that about one-third of women in Lesotho suffer sexual or physical violence in their lifetime and that GBV costs the country 5.5% of its gross domestic product in lost income and expenses associated with medical, legal, and police support. Activists blame patriarchy for fuelling GBV in the country (Sello, 2021). Despite the Sexual Offences Act (2003) and the Married Persons Act (2006) providing for equal rights for men and women in marriage, the Customary Law subordinating women to men is still very much part of society in Lesotho. In June 2022, the Upper House passed the Counter Domestic Violence Bill 2021, but critics say policing and judicial responses will also need to be strengthened to reduce the country’s GBV problem (Chikowore, 2022). This dispatch reports on a special survey module included in the Afrobarometer Round 9 (2021/2022) questionnaire to explore Africans’ experiences and perceptions of GBV. In Lesotho, most citizens say physical force is never justified to discipline women. But they say that gender-based violence is a common occurrence and constitutes the most important women’s-rights issue that the government and the country must address. A majority of Basotho believe that the police are likely to take GBV cases seriously and that GBV should be treated as a criminal rather than a private matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNAIDS,"8th March, 2021",,https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2021/march/20210308_lesotho-legal-system-curb-gender-based-violence,"When Lineo Tsikoane gave birth to her daughter, she was inspired to intensify her advocacy for gender equality to give Nairasha a better life as a girl growing up in Lesotho. “I think a big light went off in my head to say, “What if the world that I’m going to leave will not be as pure as I imagine?” I ask myself, “What kind of world do I want to leave my daughter in?”” she says. are survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. “Our main focus is gender-based violence, because this happens to be a country that has one of the highest incidences of rape and intimate partner crime in the world,” she says. Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, violence against women and girls had reached epidemic proportions globally. According to UN Women, 243 million women and girls worldwide were abused by an intimate partner in the past year. In Lesotho, it is one in three women and girls. Less than 40% of women who experience violence report it or seek help. As countries implemented lockdown measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, violence against women, especially domestic violence, intensified—in some countries, calls to helplines increased fivefold. In others, formal reports of domestic violence have decreased as survivors find it harder to seek help and access support through the regular channels. School closures and economic strains left women and girls poorer, out of school and out of jobs, and more vulnerable to exploitation, abuse, forced marriage and harassment. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) works together with UNAIDS, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization on 2gether4SRHR, a joint programme funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, to address HIV and sexual and reproductive health in Lesotho. During Lesotho’s lockdowns, UNFPA worked with Gender Links, the Lesotho Mobile Police Service and others to support efforts to prevent and respond to incidences of gender-based violence. “We are ensuring that a helpline, where people experiencing gender-based violence can call, is in place and is working and we are also providing relevant information through various platforms for people to access all the information they need on gender-based violence,” says Manthabeleng Mabetha, the UNFPA Country Director for Lesotho. Mantau Kolisang, a local policeman from Quthing, Lesotho’s southernmost district, characterized by rolling hills and vast landscapes, says one reason why gender-based violence is prevalent in Lesotho is because the law is not heeded in the rural areas. “It’s difficult to implement the law since these are remote areas,” he says, adding that while he has made arrests, he has no transport to access far-flung areas in the small mountainous region.  Lesotho’s law states that a girl can marry at the age of 16 years. However, Mr Kolisang says cultural practices, coupled with contraventions of the law, has made some men believe a 13-year-old girl “can be a wife”, exposing Basotho girls to violence. “Men don’t regard it as a crime,” he says, adding that girls have been abducted from the mountains for forced marriages. Between 2013 and 2019, 35% of adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa were married before the age of 18 years. Girls married before 18 years of age are more likely to experience intimate partner violence than those married after the age of 18. Because of poverty, gender inequality, harmful practices (such as child, early or forced marriage), poor infrastructure and gender-based violence, girls are denied access to education, one of the strongest predictors of good health and well-being in women and their children.In Lesotho’s legal system, women are regarded as perpetual minors. This categorization infantilizes women, Ms Tsikoane says. A man who abuses a woman can often walk away unscathed from the justice system if he says the woman in question is his “wife”, she adds.“This makes women vulnerable to commodification because a child can be passed around,” she says.Ms Tsikoane says there is a direct link between the minority status of women and HIV infection in Lesotho. In 2019, there were 190 000 women 15 years and older living with HIV in Lesotho, compared to 130 000 men. Adolescent girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 24 years are particularly vulnerable. They accounted for a quarter of the 11 000 new HIV infections in Lesotho in 2019. “My hypothesis is women cannot negotiate safe sex,” says Ms Tsikoane. The dangerous reality that Basotho women live in worries Mr Kolisang. But due to a lack of institutional support and resources, he feels his actions have limited effect. “I feel for these children. I feel for these women. I do feel for them. I can help, but the problem is how?” he laments. Ms Tsikoane says she finds “trinkets of opportunities” for her and her colleagues to help their clients and navigate a legal system that is not favourable towards women. “So, if you are not being well assisted at a police station, if you feel like someone is dragging your case and you are struggling to get an audience, we are there. We will support you and we will fight with you,” she says. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HeForShe-UN,30th June 2022,"Lehakoe Recreational Centre, Maseru",https://www.heforshe.org/en/addressing-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-sgbv-hiv-vulnerability-through-mobilising-men-lesotho,"The Symposium of Traditional Leaders and Faith Leaders in Lesotho was held on 30 June 2022, at Lehakoe Recreational Centre, Maseru, with the aim of bolstering a dynamic and vast collaborative experience between the Principal Chiefs and Faith Leaders. The symposium was organized by UN Women South Africa Multi Country office through Man Up Lesotho who seek to address sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) and HIV vulnerability through mobilising men.According to a study done in Lesotho in 2014, eighty-six percent (86%) of women experienced some form of Violence Against Women & Girls (VAWG) at least once in their lifetime, including partner and non-partner violence. This condition is attributed income disparities, related power imbalance and patriarchal norms amongst others.‘Sekoele-Banna’ - Man Up’s initiative, directs men to review their identity in the society as partners, protectors and not perpetrators. It touches the core foundation of manhood in the society hence involvement of traditional leaders as custodians of culture and the fabric of Basotho heritage. The initiative has created a platform for men, especially men opinion leaders (faith and traditional leaders) to have a space where they share experiences with each other. These efforts include the provision of response and long-term care services for survivors of violence. They also include efforts to address social cultural norms, structures of gender inequality and the general acceptance of VAWG.The one-day symposium gave a chance for participants to reflect, through interactive discussions on own issues and experiences during their tenure of office. These discussions challenged the status quo, the harmful mindsets, and practices. This made it easier to focus on analysing, share and enhance understanding of underlying lessons, practices and thereby lessons derived from those at the grassroots. Some of the outcomes of the symposium were that harmful social norms that sustain GBV include norms over women’s sexual purity, protecting family honor over women’s safety, and men’s authority to discipline women and children. The team sought to work with traditional leaders to develop measures to change harmful social norms and personal beliefs that maintain and tolerate sexual violence and other forms of GBV against women and girls in Lesotho, as this enhance vulnerability to HIV. The participants highlighted need for more consistent engagements with the traditional leadership of the Country from the King down to customary headmen, in order to ensure sustainable change of harmful socio-cultural practices which enhance vulnerability to GBV and HIV/AIDS.

UNFPA,11th July 2018,,https://www.unfpa.org/news/tackle-sexual-violence-lesotho-programme-targets-men-and-boys,"HABA TSEKA, Lesotho – “Before, I never used a condom, and I would force myself violently onto girls and young women,” said Kabelo*, 22, in rural Lesotho. A herder in Haba Tseka, he grew up in an area where violence is considered a normal, masculine trait. Thapeli*, 21, grew up with similar views. He never attended school, and instead spent his time herding sheep, goats and cattle in the mountains.He also says he used to abuse girls, intercepting them on their way home from school, even forcing them to have sex. “I felt strong in those moments because I had learned that this is how women should be treated,” he said. But both men say they have changed.
They participated in UNFPA-supported information sessions, which introduced them to ideas about human rights – including women’s and girls’ right to live free of abuse and violence.They learned about the importance of respect and communication.Today, they say they want other men and boys to know these things, too.Violence and vulnerability In the highlands of Lesotho, young herders – commonly called ‘herd boys’ – learn to fight each other over territory. There is a common saying: “Fighting is the only solution to conflict.” “Fighting became a means of communication and [a] demonstration of power,” said Sello Matsoso, an officer at Help Lesotho, the UNFPA partner conducting the information sessions.Violence against women and girls is often normalized. According to a 2014 national survey, 33 per cent of women and 40 per cent of men in Lesotho believe wife beating can be justified. To make matters more challenging, discussing sexuality or sex is considered taboo, even among friends or with partners. As a result, many young people do not know how to address issues of consent. Many young people also lack information about how to prevent HIV, which is dangerously widespread. Lesotho has an adult HIV prevalence rate of 25 per cent, one of the highest in the world. “Even if I had heard of HIV transmission, I didn't know that it could happen through sexual relations,” Kabelo told UNFPA. In Lesotho, UNFPA supports the Lapeng Centre, which provides support to survivors of gender-based violence and helps them pursue justice. UNFPA also works with police and other law enforcement personnel to strengthen their response to violence. But with studies showing that herd boys are frequently among the perpetrators of gender-based violence, it was clear that efforts must also be directed towards them. In 2014, UNFPA and Help Lesotho began offering the information sessions, targeting herd boys as well as other at-risk groups, such as out-of-school youth and adolescent mothers.
The programme involves an intensive five-day training, and then monthly meetings for six to eight months. It covers interpersonal skills, goal setting, anger management, and how to communicate and negotiate respectfully with others. It also provides comprehensive sexuality education, including how to access health services and prevent HIV transmission.  These lessons have been eye-opening to many participants. “I now know violence is wrong. Communicating and agreeing is my new approach to the opposite sex,” said Thapeli. Effective approach Over 600 herder boys and young men have been reached thus far.In evaluations, chiefs, parents and other community members say that the young men’s behaviour and attitudes have indeed changed. “Now I communicate respectfully with my partner to negotiate the use of a condom,” Kabelo said. “I always use a condom now.” Thapeli says he wants to share what he has learned with family and friends. “I have learned to stop the violence. I want to teach and inspire others to do the same,” he told UNFPA. “I feel like a real man now, with respect for girls and women,” said Thapeli.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UN- LESOTHO,2022,,https://lesotho.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/UN%20Newsletter%20August%202022.pdf,"Lesotho has one of the highest incidences of sexual and gender-based violence in the world. According  to the World Population Review 2022 report, 86% of Basotho women have experienced gender-based  violence (GBV) in their lifetime. Lesotho also ranks third in the world with the highest rape instances per capita and sixth highest murder rates ahead of countries at war.  It has become imperative to seek alternative ways of dealing with this scourge. Although there have been strides toward addressing gaps in legislation and customary practices that perpetuate GBV against women in Lesotho, there is a lot that still needs to be done to ameliorate the situation of
women and girls in terms of prevention and response to SGBV. There have been a number of International Partners operating in the Kingdom of Lesotho supporting the promotion of gender equality and the elimination of GBV, either through specific programs and  initiatives or through mainstreaming efforts. The government and several civil society organizations have also put in place initiatives aimed at preventing and addressing SGBV. The United Nations in Lesotho has identified addressing SGBV as one of the priority areas for program implementation. The situation of safety and lives of women in particular and other groups vulnerable to violence has become
worrying and therefore requiring an approach that is structural, systematic and collaborative. To harmonize and create a synergy of interventions as well as leverage resource mobilization, there is an increased need for effective coordination to avoid duplication as well as stimulate national ownership through a coordinated approach towards governmental and civil society stakeholders. In July 2022, the Ministry of Gender, Youth, Sports and Recreation, therefore, found it fitting in collaboration with the UN, civil society organizations, the private sector, development partners to reconvene and re-energise the Anti-Gender Based Violence Forum. The aim of the forum remains focused on a systematic coordination and programming for SGVB in Lesotho. It shall do this by informing, strengthening, and facilitating as well as coordination of multi-sectoral and gender-inclusive efforts in Lesotho. Opening the forum, the Minister of Gender, Youth, Sports and Recreation Honourable Likeleli Tampane,
highlighted that the ministry has made progress in formulating laws that protect women from GBV, such as the Counter Domestic Violence Law and the Harmonization of Rights of Widows under customary law with the Legal Capacity of Married Persons’ Act. The UN Resident Coordinator, Amanda Khozi Mukwashi applauded the ministry for creating a platform for decision-making on GBV issues in the country and for leading the forum. “Despite the current challenges in dealing with GBV, I am hopeful that this platform will facilitate and be catalyst to the achievement of multi-sectoral approach response to GBV in Lesotho”, she remarked. Ending GBV in Lesotho will be a driver for progress across all the other Sustainable Development Goals that Lesotho aims to achieve by 2030, we all have a role to play, let us end it today. The Government of Lesotho, through the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office, alongside the UN Nutrition Secretariat, organized a one-day workshop on July 20, 2022, at the Avani Maseru Hotel in Maseru to validate the results of the stakeholder and nutrition action mapping, which was undertaken in 2021. The nutrition mapping exercise assists to improve coordination among partners and provide necessary information for strengthening nutrition actions and planning purposes across sectors. For districts, the
mapping provides information on how many beneficiaries are being reached and which actions may need to be scaled up. For ministries, it assists in identifying gaps in the coverage of districts and beneficiaries, and for the UN, NGOs, and donors the mapping supports identifying actions that may need more support. Key stakeholders made statements during the opening ceremony, including senior representatives from the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO), FNCO officers from all districts, UN Nutrition Secretariat, and the World Food Programme. Opening the workshop, the PS of Economic Affairs in the Prime Minister’s Office, Bereng Makotoko
remarked: “It is fulfilling to note that we are gathered here today to share the findings of the nutrition actions mapping conducted by our technical people to establish “Who is doing What Where and How” with one goal of addressing food and nutrition insecurity. I do hope you will be able to identify gaps and devise means of doing better in improving the livelihoods of our people and building a resilent nation.” The efforts of the mapping exercise will prove valuable as Lesotho grapples with malnutrition, which has negatively affected physical and cognitive development, leading to poor social and economic outcomes. While Lesotho made significant gains in reducing stunting and wasting over the last two decades, the burden of malnutrition remains high with stalled progress in recent years and inequities persist across wealth quintiles and regions. About a third of children under five are stunted in Lesotho, and child undernutrition is estimated to cause 20% of child deaths in the country and a loss of 7% of GDP
annually.

International Commission of Jurists,21st April 2023,,https://www.icj.org/lesotho-activists-call-for-increased-sensitization-of-key-stakeholders-on-human-rights-of-lgbtiq-people/,"On 17 and 18 April 2023, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and the People’s Matrix Association held a workshop with the Lesotho judiciary where a range of human rights issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) were discussed. The workshop took place in Maseru, the country’s capital, and was aimed at facilitating exchanges among participants, including judges and magistrates, with a view to enhancing everyone’s understanding of the human rights of LGBTIQ+ persons in Lesotho and the challenges they face in accessing justice and effective remedies for violations of their human rights.  It was a follow-up to the initial half-day judicial engagement workshop co-hosted by ICJ and OutRight International at the request of Lesotho’s judiciary in October 2022. In his opening and concluding remarks, the country’s Acting Chief Justice, Tšeliso Monapathi, underscored that, in his opinion, there was a significant need for judges, magistrates and Lesotho’s society as a whole to be sensitized on the human rights of LGBTIQ+ persons. Indeed, at the October 2022 judicial engagement workshop, participating members of the judiciary had expressed an interest in deepening their knowledge about the personal experiences of LGBTIQ+ persons in Lesotho in accessing justice through the courts. “It is encouraging to see that the Lesotho judiciary continues to take SOGIE issues seriously, and that they are willing to learn more about the challenges preventing the LGBTIQ+ community in Lesotho from exercising their human rights,” Ratalane said. “This is a positive step towards improving access to justice for LGBTIQ+ persons. Members of the People’s Matrix and those who we engage from the LGBTIQ+ community continue to be subjected to varying forms of discrimination and violence on the basis of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Many report struggling to access courts and significant challenges with a range of justice actors including police officers, prosecutors, correctional services personnel and healthcare workers.” she added. In Lesotho, discrimination against LGBTIQ+ persons manifests in various forms including: violence and abuse against the LGBTIQ+ individuals, such as killings, forced initiations to purportedly “convert” a person from their real or imputed same-sex sexual orientation to a heterosexual one or “restore” transgender persons to a cisgender identity; rape and other forms of sexual assault, intimidation and harassment; bullying; denial of access to healthcare services, such as gender affirming care; and other forms of social exclusion, such as rejection of LGBTIQ+ children by family members. While there has been some legislative progress in protecting the human rights of LGBTIQ+ persons, including the decriminalization of consensual same-sex sexual conduct in 2010, human rights violations and abuses against LGBTIQ+ individuals continue to be reported. Judges and magistrates present at the workshop discussed ways in which the judiciary could ensure equal access to justice for LGBTIQ+ people. For instance, as Ratalane noted during her presentation at the event, this may entail being sensitive to the needs of LGBTIQ+ persons appearing before them so as to better enable them to participate in court proceedings more effectively. The workshop discussed how judges could also continue to make progress by interpreting existing laws in Lesotho in a manner consistent with the country’s international human rights law obligations. ICJ Africa’s Legal and Communications Associate Officer, Mulesa Lumina, emphasized the importance of making available to judicial officers tools, information and resources that would enable them to adjudicate matters involving the human rights of LGBTIQ+ individuals in Lesotho in ways that strive to ensure  compliance with the country’s international human rights law obligations: “Lesotho is a State Party to a number of international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and, as such, is obliged to prevent abuse, attacks and discrimination against LGBTIQ+ persons by third parties. It is also bound to proactively address barriers to the enjoyment of human rights,” she said. “The ICJ remains committed to working with a wide range of stakeholders promoting the human rights of LGBTIQ+ people in Lesotho, including their rights to equality and freedom from violence and discrimination, and to ensuring the country’s compliance with its international law obligations. Judges have a vital role to play in ensuring that the human rights of everyone, regardless of their real or imputed SOGIESC be upheld,” she added.Contact Mulesa Lumina, Legal and Communications Associate Officer (Africa Regional Programme), e: mulesa.lumina@icj.org Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, Director (Africa Regional Programme), e: kaajal.keogh@icj.org 
Background  High court judges and magistrates convened for the workshop facilitated by ICJ and the People’s Matrix to discuss a range of human rights issues related to sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. In particular, facilitators unpacked the obstacles to the realization of the human rights of LGBTIQ+ persons in Lesotho, including their rights to freedom from discrimination, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In terms of its international human rights obligations, Lesotho must ensure that LGBTIQ+ persons are protected from discrimination and violence and that their dignity and right to equality be upheld. Lesotho is a State Party to a number of international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (the African Charter) and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa. The Yogyakarta Principles and the Yogyakarta Principles Plus 10 are an authoritative affirmation that the rights of LGBTIQ+ persons are human rights and a guide on the obligations of States as regards the application of international human rights law and standards in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex haracteristics. In addition, the landmark Resolution 275 of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights on Protection against Violence and other Human Rights violations against Persons on the basis of their real or imputed sexual orientation or gender identity reiterates that the Africa Charter protects the human rights of all persons, including LGBTIQ+ persons, to non-discrimination, equality, life, dignity and freedom from torture. The resolution also calls on all States to put in place measures that will put a stop to violence and discrimination against LGBTIQ+ persons. Most recently, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights also released Resolution 552 on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Intersex Persons in Africa, the first resolution from Africa on the human rights of intersex persons, calling on States to promote and protect the human rights of intersex persons on the African continent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Worker Driven Social Responsibility Network (WSN),2019,,https://wsr-network.org/success-stories/gender-justice-in-lesotho-apparel/,"Launched in 2019, the “Agreements to Prevent and Combat Gender-Based Violence and Harassment in Lesotho” are making great progress towards their goals of addressing sexual harassment and gender-based violence in the Lesotho-based suppliers of several major apparel brands. This historic binding agreement has been a tremendous accomplishment for Lesotho garment workers, who, though their unions, are ending the pervasive abuses in garment factories The program’s success to date also shows the adaptability and scalability of the Worker-driven Social Responsibility model, which continues to prove just how effective it is at protecting workers’ fundamental human rights in global supply chains spanning three continents and multiple industries. Any worker who experiences harassment or coercion has the right to file a complaint with the independent monitoring body Workers’ Rights Watch, which will investigate the complaint and impose remedies. Such remedies can include requiring the employer to terminate the abuser – an action that would have been practically unheard of in the global apparel industry prior to this agreement; Robust anti-retaliation provisions to ensure that complainants and witnesses are protected; An in-depth training program for workers about their rights under the program. Workers are compensated by their employer for the time they spend in these trainings; Strong protections against any interference with, or retaliation against, workers’ exercise of their associational rights; and Many other provisions as outlined in the announcement here. Unlike the voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSRs) programs and multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) that are often used to deflect public scrutiny of abuses, this binding agreement includes strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the employer and the buyers comply with their commitments. In the case of the brands, they can be subject to legal action for violating the program’s terms. In the case of the employer, Nien Hsing faces a potential loss of business if it fails to uphold the agreement. As demonstrated in other WSR programs, such consequences are critical to ensuring that workplace improvements are implemented and maintained over time. “Our situation changed a lot. We can now report incidences of [gender-based violence and harrassment. … I speak openly to workers about how the [Workers Rights Watch] assisted me in my case and how grateful I am for them.” —A Nien Hsing worker First Progress Report Highlights “A Fundamental Transformation” for Workers The first progress report on program implementation notes that “most workers expressed a basic level of trust in the complaint mechanism and a willingness to report abuse through that mechanism—a fundamental transformation from the previous attitudes to reporting Gender-Based Violence and Harassment.” Program Development Highlights Scalability, Adaptability of WSR Model This program was developed in the face of overwhelming odds, as workers at the Nien Hsing Textile Co. in Lesotho came together to demand respect and justice in the workplace, and an end to a pervasive environment of gender-based violence. The agreement would not have come about without years of courageous organizing by the three unions representing garment workers at the supplier, Nien Hsing Textile: the Independent Democratic Union of Lesotho (IDUL), the United Textile Employees (UNITE), and the National Clothing Textile and Allied Workers Union (NACTWU). Equally important in achieving these agreements were the Federation of Women Lawyers in Lesotho (FIDA) and Women and Law in Southern African Research and Education Trust-Lesotho (WLSA), two of Lesotho’s leading women’s rights advocates. WLSA and FIDA joined with the three unions to battle workplace harassment and abuse at the factories. The unions helped the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) document and expose the reality in the factories, through an intensive investigation. The WRC recommended that the unions and women’s groups join forces to pursue a WSR agreement with the factory’s three main buyers and then pressed the buyers, Levi’s, The Children’s Place, and Kontoor Brands, to come to the table. WRC, the Solidarity Center, and Workers United then worked side-by-side with the Lesotho union and women’s rights leaders to negotiate with the brands and Nien Hsing. Throughout, FIDA’s and WLSA’s insights were indispensable in the design of the anti-sexual harassment program the new agreements will create. The complaint mechanism outlined in the agreement and implemented by Workers’ Rights Watch was modeled after the one in the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ (CIW) Fair Food Program, an initiative that has been uniquely successful in addressing a culture of sexual harassment and gender-based violence that had persisted for years in the US agricultural industry. The program also draws from the experience of the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry which has transformed safety conditions and dramatically reduced workplace hazards for more than two million garment workers in Bangladesh and is now expanding to Pakistan. The Fair Food Standards Council (FFSC) and CIW shared expertise and protocols, and provided strategic advice and support during the process, which included a two-day exchange in Immokalee, Florida between representatives from the organizations in Lesotho, CIW, FFSC, WRC, Solidarity Center, and WSR Network. The development of the Lesotho Agreement underscores the adaptability of the WSR model and the infrastructure and support that exist for its expansion. It is more clear than ever that the biggest obstacle that exists for expansion of the model is brands’ unwillingness to sign binding agreements and commit to meaningful action, not a failure of the WSR model. This is the second example of a WSR program in the global apparel industry, following the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, which the WRC and two other Network members, Clean Clothes Campaign and the International Labor Rights Forum, helped to create and implement. The Solidarity Center is taking the lead in supporting the Lesotho organizations on program implementation with support from the WRC.

World Bank Blogs,June 5th 2020,,https://blogs.worldbank.org/youth-transforming-africa/how-lesotho-mother-kingdom-managed-eradicate-child-marriages,"In this winning Blog4Dev post, the author imagines a future in which child marriage in Lesotho has been eradicated. “Mama, why does that picture show a 13-year-old girl getting married to an old man?” asked Sello with a frown. The year is 2030, Sello and his mother are at the national museum viewing artifacts. He, a 10-year-old, looks bewildered. ‘Masello, his mother, ventures on to explain the issue of child marriage that used to exist in the past to her son, who looks appalled at the history. “So how did you eradicate this monstrous crime against humanity, mama? This truly feels like a tale.” How did Lesotho achieve eradication of child marriages? Through the effort of everyone in the country. Lesotho believed that it takes a village to raise a child, and through this principle, managed to eradicate what had arguably been the biggest challenge for the country. Through community engagement, citizens began examining the root causes of child marriage. Culture, socio-economic development, low status attached to women and education were identified as some of the root causes for early marriage. With this information, leaders developed a national strategic vision plan to end child marriages with specific timelines, clear targets and indicators. The president began by prioritizing the fight against child marriages in the national budget, which gave the government enough resources to help in fighting child marriages. The customary marriage law, which did not stipulate any age in which a child could be married—thus indirectly endorsing child marriages—was amended and penalties for child marriages were put in place. There were countrywide social mobilization campaigns held in communities where child marriages were rampant. Since culture was one of the main drivers of child marriages, respected local community leaders were targeted to champion the fight against child marriages. The state ensured that they got local buy-in from the communities, and sensitized and educated them on the importance of educating the girl child and ensuring that all the females in the economy contribute to its meaningful development. The buy-in from the local communities ensured that whenever a child marriage is encountered in the village, it is immediately reported. The main perpetrators of child marriages, males, were targeted intentionally. This was because in order for child marriages to end, the law of supply and demand ascertains that without demand, there would be no supply. In an effort to address socio-economic forces such as poverty and hunger—which often drove parents and caretakers to marry off their children to survive—the government embarked on livelihood diversification strategy to ensure that poverty-stricken communities become poverty free. The nation also adopted a free education system for high schools, where most girls used to drop out of school due to lack of funds. The educational system was also amended to accommodate for young girls who are often married off when they fall pregnant in schools. Girls were enrolled into summer school programs where, in additional to the national curricula, they were taught entrepreneurship skills. “That is how we overcame the impossible,” said ‘Masello.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mandela Worshington Fellowship,2021,,https://www.mandelawashingtonfellowship.org/program-impact-stories/bringing-maternal-care-to-remote-communities-in-lesotho/,"Mamello Makhele 2021 Fellowship Alumna, Lesotho Bringing Maternal Care to Remote Communities in Lesotho In the landlocked country of Lesotho, many remote communities lack access to healthcare and education services. 2021 Fellowship Alumna Mamello Makhele has committed herself to bridging this divide. Mamello, a registered midwife, has been fighting to bring maternal care, health care, and contraceptives to some of the country’s hardest-to-reach places.  Due to the country’s mountainous terrain, she travels on foot or by donkey to ensure women in these communities receive the care they need. In 2017, a patient suffering complications from an unsafe abortion arrived at the clinic Mamello worked at. Fearing stigma, the young woman’s family didn’t bring her in for care right away, and the woman later died from these complications. Mamello decided then that she wanted to work directly with women across the country to prevent deaths like this one.“I decided to resign from the hospital and work in these hard-to-reach places… I wanted to understand the issues that women faced on an everyday basis,” Mamello said. “For me to be an advocate, it wasn’t enough to read about these issues but to engage with them and learn about their cultures, their traditions, and the way they think.”Across Lesotho, women face barriers that prevent them from seeking maternal care and other medical care. Some travel over two hours to the nearest medical center. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these clinics have closed their doors, shutting off access to essential services for many women. During her visits to local communities, Mamello provides educational sessions on family planning, contraceptives, and maternal care and promotes community awareness on women’s health, gender-based violence, and HIV.  She doesn’t just speak with pregnant women and mothers during her visits, but also engages youth, spouses, and village leaders in these important conversations.“The idea is to educate men to be better advocates…and also to become better partners.” In 2021, Mamello participated in the Mandela Washington Fellowship, studying Leadership in Civic Engagement with Appalachian State University. During the Fellowship, she strengthened her network and honed her public speaking skills. Later that year, Mamello was invited to address members of the Parliament of Lesotho on matters related to abortion laws.She says, “[The Fellowship] also taught us about project management, which was something I was not too familiar with [coming into the program].”Since participating in the Fellowship, she was selected as one of Bill Gates’ Heroes in the Field.“It’s still so serene… For people to celebrate women in the rural areas,” Mamello said.  “It is a dream come true for me.”Looking to the future, Mamello is excited to explore emerging opportunities to utilize technology to reach rural communities, such as utilizing drones to deliver health services. In addition, Mamello is currently serving as a board member for Safe Abortion Action Fund in London. This organization provides funding to grassroots movements across different countries to promote abortion rights.“This means that I will be able to expand my work not only in Lesotho, but also Africa and other continents. It is amazing.” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Global Sisters Report ,"October 24th, 2022",Berea Plateau,https://www.globalsistersreport.org/news/teen-moms-lesotho-find-shelter-education-local-sisters,"BEREA PLATEAU, Lesotho – Susan tries to smile as she holds her crying baby while seated on a mattress in a small room at Good Shepherd Centre for Teenage Mothers. But it does not entirely erase the pain in her eyes. The 17-year-old dropped out of 10th grade last year after a 30-year-old farm laborer got her pregnant. Her grandmother, with whom she lived, became disappointed after learning she was pregnant and, together with her uncles, chased her out of their home.She sought refuge at the Good Shepherd Centre for Teenage Mothers in Berea Plateau, a small mountainous town about 12 miles from Maseru, the country’s capital. The Good Shepherd Sisters of Quebec of the Lesotho Province run the center, which they founded in 1995.""I had nowhere to go, but when I arrived at the center, the sisters happily welcomed me,"" she said. ""My relatives told me to leave our home because I would embarrass them. The sisters have been of great help to me. My son is being taken care of at the daycare while I am training in dressmaking.""Susan (who asked not to use her real name) said her problems started at age 4, when her mother left her with her grandmother to go to South Africa to seek a job. She never returned. Susan said her mother's absence greatly contributed to her current situation because she had no one to advise and guide her. My uncles used to tell me that my mother abandoned me and went to South Africa for work, and later on, she died of HIV,"" she recalled, tears streaming down her cheeks as she tugged nervously at her blouse. ""I don't think she ever loved me at all.""Susan's story is far from unique: Thousands of girls in this tiny landlocked country in southern Africa are forced to abandon their education as punishment for being pregnant. Because the country's culture discourages premarital sex, a girl who becomes pregnant before marriage is likely to be excluded or banished from her community or family and is referred to as a ""spoiled girl.""
Religious sisters try to help these teen mothers with a safe and supportive place to live while they learn to care for themselves and their children.Good Shepherd Sr. Filipina Hlobotsi said most young mothers at the center come from communities with high poverty, HIV and unemployment. In Lesotho, pregnant girls are left on their own and it seems their life is over, she said.""We started the center because we saw the challenges of teenage mothers,"" said Hlobotsi, the center's outgoing administrator. ""When a girl falls pregnant while still in school, they are sent away, which means their education stops there. Most of them are chased away from their homes, and because of this, they used to come to our convents asking for any help they could get.""We realized that others were undergoing abortions, and some even died during the process."" the cause of teen pregnancy A United Nations Population Fund report indicates that Lesotho is among the leading countries in early and unintended pregnancies, with the adolescent birth rate at 94 per 1,000 girls age 15-19.Analysts have blamed high poverty and unemployment as the leading causes of early pregnancy in Lesotho, a high-altitude kingdom encircled by South Africa. With a 36% poverty rate, the country of 2.2 million is experiencing nearly 25% unemployment, a rate that is projected to remain high due to the effects of the pandemic.The situation has forced thousands of Basotho (the people of Lesotho) to migrate to neighboring South Africa to work in its mines and as domestic workers to provide for their families back home, Hlobotsi said, a trek that puts women at risk of getting trafficked. The children, meanwhile, are left under a relative's care. Nthabeleng Ntoko, 27, whose parents abandoned her for jobs in South Africa, got pregnant at 16.Ntoko, who lives at Good Shepherd with her child, said a man in his early 40s who was working at Letseng Diamond Mine near the border of South Africa would give her a lot of money when he visited.
""I would not have been pregnant if I had parents to guide me,"" she said, adding that her uncles kicked her out of their home after realizing she was pregnant. ""Everyone in the community didn't want to see me. I was forced to drop out of school and seek refuge at the center.""""I didn't know anything about sex and love,"" she added. ""Maybe my mother or father would have advised me to abstain from sex to avoid early pregnancy. I needed that knowledge at the time, but it was not there.""'Here to look for money'In Lesotho, like in many other mining countries, women are not allowed to work in mines or engage in dangerous tasks. Young women — some underage — follow men working in mines along the borders and in South Africa, selling sex to older men to support their families.Global Sisters Report visited Maputsoe, an industrial town in northern Lesotho, to meet men and women engaging in sex for money. Maputsoe is a border town where mineworkers heading to their workplaces from Lesotho stop to have fun and party before crossing the border to South Africa. Dubbed the town that never sleeps, Maputsoe is loaded with tourism activities, including taverns, traditional dance performances and strip clubs. It is just past 7 p.m. on the last Saturday of the month. The streets are still full and buzzing with activity, with no signs of slowing down. Hundreds of near-naked girls and women parade through the town's bars, brothels and streets, advertising themselves to miners approaching them.""I am here to look for money and assist my two children,"" said a 35-year-old woman with braided hair and wearing a skimpy blue dress. ""It's the end (of the) month, and most miners here have received their salaries, so we take advantage of this time to make money.""The woman, who requested anonymity, said she left Maseru two years ago, after her husband went to South Africa to look for a job but never returned, leaving her to care for their children.""It's not easy to raise two children as a single mother,"" she said, adding that she left her children with her mother. ""On a good night, especially at the end of the month, I make up to 500 Lesotho loti (about $30) and send that money back home.""One miner told GSR that because men left their wives at home, they can't resist paying women for sex. ""Every weekend we go to the neighboring villages and towns to look for women so that we enjoy and relax while taking alcohol,"" he said. ""The only way a man finds pleasure is by having a woman."" The 55-year-old noted that most men don't use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, saying they are not easy to find in the region. ""We don't have condoms here, yet we sleep daily with different women and girls,"" he said.The activities make Lesotho one of the highest HIV-infected countries in the world. According to data from UNAIDS, about 1 in 6 people in Lesotho lives with HIV, and more women are affected than men: 27.7% of women live with HIV, compared to 19.7% of men.""Men working in the mines have a lot of money, and they use it to entice young girls they are not interested in marrying because they have their wives,"" Hlobotsi said. ""These men end up leaving these young girls with pregnancies and, in the worst scenarios, HIV. The young girls are forced to drop out of school and are left to take care of their newborns without knowing how to breastfeed, diaper, bathe and other baby care concerns."" Religious sisters have launched initiatives to address this worrying trend.Hlobotsi said the Good Shepherd Centre accommodates 58 teen mothers and their children. The young mothers spend two years learning skills such as hairdressing, sewing, farming and cooking.""We are empowering these young mothers with skills so they can take care of themselves and live decent lives,"" she said, noting that the center also welcomes sexually trafficked and abused women. ""We don't discriminate. We admit all young mothers and those facing other abuses regardless of their faith, level of education or social status.""The sisters have opened the school to the community, allowing parents to drop off their children to study, charging a fee that then helps the sisters manage the school and center.They also have a health facility that serves teen mothers and the surrounding community.""When the girls get here, they have to be tested for HIV, and also they have to start their antenatal care,"" said Good Shepherd Sr. Rosemary Mokebe, who now directs the center. The women learn how to live with the disease, she said, adding that the sisters and staff accompany the women through their delivery and recovery, also looking after the children's well-being.Mokebe plans to expand the center's projects, including sponsoring advanced education for girls who want to become professionals.""We can’t just stop these young girls from achieving their dreams just because they became mothers at a young age,"" she said.To reduce the alarming rate of teenage pregnancies in the country, sisters have started an awareness campaign directed at leaders and elders of communities, as well as parents and children. And every three months, sisters visit men working in the mines to talk to them about the importance of respecting and caring for children. They also visit villages and homes to encourage young girls and boys to abstain from sex, to educate them about the dangers of contracting HIV, and urging parents to embrace their daughters if they get pregnant unintentionally.""We are happy because our message is being received positively, and we believe we will be able to eradicate the vice,"" Hlobotsi said.Still, teen mothers say harsher punishments for sexual offenders and stricter enforcement of the laws would also help stem the tide of teenage pregnancy.""Those older men taking advantage of young girls should be jailed,"" Susan said. ""Most of the people who [got] us pregnant are out there, and they continue to destroy the lives of other young girls.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,9th April 2010,,https://www.pih.org/article/expanding-the-role-of-traditional-birth-attendants-in-lesotho,"In the small southern African country of Lesotho, about one out of every four adults is HIV positive, and high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity threaten the country’s young mothers. The rough, mountainous terrain and lack of roads exacerbates the situation, preventing many people from easily accessing the medical services eeded to curb the epidemics.To help address these problems, Partners In Health Lesotho (PIHL) is using traditional birth attendants (TBA)—local traditional midwives—to provide women living in rural mountain villages with access to comprehensive services including HIV testing, counselling, and treatment; methods of preventing HIV transmission from mother-to-child; and antenatal (prebirth), delivery, and general post-birth health care; immunizations; as well as general reproductive health services.In May 2009, PIHL, in partnership with the Elton John AIDS Foundation, began to pilot a TBA program in a catchment area that includes 71 villages around PIHL’s health center in Bobete. PIHL hired and trained 100 local women to serve as a link between the clinic and pregnant women—who are literally their neighbors. The TBAs locate and accompany the expectant mothers through their pregnancy and birth to ensure that they have full access to the clinic’s comprehensive services. This includes bringing the women to the clinic to deliver their babies.The TBAs are a part of Lesotho’s traditional midwifery community and PIHL seeks not to replace them, but to further their education and employ them in an expanded role as community health workers in the communities of which they are already a part. And as families traditionally pay TBAs for delivering babies, the PIHL program provides a cash incentive for each woman a TBA accompanies, replacing the income lost when women choose to deliver at the health center. In the first six months of the project, the TBAs completed their training, surveyed their villages, and began to visit pregnant women in their homes. They accompanied 172 women to the clinic for antenatal care, and accompanied 53 women to deliver at the clinic. Clinic deliveries have steadily risen in response to TBA outreach, with at least 24 women giving birth at the health center last month.The advantages of delivering in the Bobete clinic are significant, particularly in preventing the transmission of HIV during childbirth. Delivering with the assistance of a skilled nurse decreases the risks of maternal mortality and morbidity, and infants with health issues can receive immediate medical attention.To enable more women to deliver at the health center, PIHL is renting waiting houses near the clinic that can shelter six women at a time. Rough terrain separating the remote villages from the health center can make the journey virtually impossible for a woman with labor complications, so these houses make it possible for women to make the journey before labor begins.As an extra incentive, PIHL also provides new mothers who fulfil certain criteria (get tested for HIV, attend at least three antenatal visits and deliver their baby at the clinic) with a new baby package, which includes clothing (hat and sweater), pins, and a bathtub. During the programs first six months, PIHL distributed 60 new baby packages.PIHL believes that the accompaniment of the TBAs and the general knowledge and care delivered during the antenatal visits will encourage each woman to deliver her baby at the clinic, and that in doing so families in the Bobete catchment area will see a decrease in HIV mother-to-child transmission rates, as well as maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates. In the coming year, the PIHL team hopes to expand this program to six more rural health centers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Relief Web,22nd February 2021,,https://reliefweb.int/report/lesotho/lesotho-better-coordination-could-save-lives-mothers,"THABA-TSEKA, 22 February 2011 (IRIN) - A new joint programme is changing the way the Lesotho government and its development partners deliver aid by getting different government departments, UN agencies and civil society organizations working together to help mothers and their families.Tens of thousands of Basotho already depend on food and agricultural assistance as well as free HIV/AIDS treatment, but the country is no closer to achieving a number of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and progress on some has reversed.Over half the population lives in extreme poverty, an estimated 23 percent of adults are infected with HIV, and for every 100,000 live births, 1,155 women died during or after delivery in 2009; up from 762 in 2004.""Because we're looking at negative trends in these areas, we discussed with the government and I think there was consensus that there was something we weren't doing right,"" said Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie, the UN resident coordinator in Lesotho.Starting in June 2010, the joint programme began targeting the four worst performing MDGs - those relating to the eradication of poverty and hunger, to reducing child and maternal mortality and combating HIV - in the four worst performing of Lesotho's 10 districts. The best chance of success, everyone agreed, was to focus interventions on helping mothers. Research has shown that improving their lives has a knock-on effect on other family members.The programme also tries to address the lack of coordination and wasted resources that have plagued aid delivery in the past.Joint assessmentsTake for example Mphu Mopeli*, who is seven months pregnant with her fifth child and living with HIV. Her only income comes from collecting and selling firewood to her neighbours and the small amount her two sons earn working as herd boys. Like many others in her district of Thaba-Tseka, one of Lesotho's most remote and impoverished areas, she might not make it without outside help.Previously, that help would have come, if it came at all, from various sources - the local clinic, the UN World Food Programme (WFP), and extension officers from the Ministry of Agriculture. Mopeli may have been listed as a beneficiary by all of these organizations who would have visited her in separate vehicles, asked her similar questions and never shared her responses with one another.Now various UN agencies and government departments are teaming up to carry out joint assessments and agree on the same group of beneficiaries to receive a comprehensive set of services.The health department is working with partners including the World Health Organization and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to identify pregnant, breast-feeding and HIV-positive mothers and their infants who are in need of food rations from the WFP. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) together with the Ministry of Agriculture makes sure the same women receive seeds, tools and advice on how to grow vegetables and raise chickens that may eventually eradicate the need for food assistance.Hard times delay MDGs Eventually, some of the women will receive training on how to start small businesses that could permanently lift them and their families out of poverty.""The concentration of complementary activities in a given location for a given population is something we've never attempted in a development context,"" said the UN's Eziakonwa-Onochie. ""The goal is to have greater impact because when you programme in bits and pieces, you miss important components and it's not sustainable or complete.""More efficientShe added that the new approach was also more efficient because it allowed for the sharing of skills and resources. In Thaba-Tseka, officials from the ministries of agriculture and health, as well as from the FAO, WFP and NGO Caritas have formed a nutrition team.""We've tried to mix people from different backgrounds,"" explained Washi Mokati, WFP head of office for the district. ""Previously, different organizations were building keyhole gardens [small raised vegetable gardens] in different styles; now we're bringing similar practices together.""Mokati added that the programme is still in its infancy and faces challenges. The new level of coordination requires ""lots of meetings and not everyone attends"".In charge of coordinating those meetings, both at national and district level, is the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO), a government entity that previously had an uncertain role as one of many government departments dealing with nutrition.""This programme has reaffirmed our coordinating role,"" said FNCO director Masekonyela Sebotsa. ""Our role is bringing everyone together so we work as a team, because often in government each ministry is doing its own work.""Now you might see [officials from] the Ministry of Health and [the Ministry of] Agriculture travelling in one car; now we work as one.""Although the UN is funding the programme until December 2012 as part of its ""Delivering as One"" initiative aimed at encouraging UN agencies to deliver development assistance in a more coordinated way, Eziakonwa-Onochie said their role had mainly be ""catalytical"".By 2012, the programme should have yielded enough results and best practices for government to decide whether to take over and replicate it in other districts.""It needs to be rooted in a national budget,"" Eziakonwa-Onochie told IRIN, ""otherwise we run the risk of starting something that fizzles out.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medicines Sans Frontireers ,3rd November 2015,,https://www.msf.org/lesotho-free-maternal-care-has-impressive-return-investment,"JOHANNESBURG/MASERU – The introduction of free deliveries at a hospital in Lesotho, the country with one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world, drastically reduced maternal deaths during labour and delivery, making the intervention a cheap and highly effective public health measure, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Tuesday. The number of women giving birth in the Roma hospital increased by 45 per cent within a year after MSF offered to cover all their expenses. This shows that fees are a huge barrier in preventing women from seeking medical help for delivery in a country where up to 40 per cent of women give birth at home without the help of a skilled attendant.“Giving life shouldn’t cost a life. But in Lesotho, delivering a baby has either a financial cost for the mother, or a dramatically high human cost for the society. Free maternal health care at both health centre and hospital level is a simple and relatively cheap measure with a huge return on investment in terms of public health”, says Dr Amir Shroufi, MSF deputy medical coordinator for South Africa and Lesotho.According to the World Bank Lesotho has one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world with estimates ranging anywhere from 600 to 1,200 deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal death in Lesotho is frequently due to complications around delivery that can be handled at hospital level: 34% due to sepsis, 20% due to post-abortion complication, 14% due to obstructed or prolonged labour and 12% due to eclampsia.Hospital fees for delivery cost as little as $10 per birth for each woman, but this fee can represent up to a month’s salary for rural people in Lesotho. The introduction of free maternal care in the country would only amount to a tiny fraction (less than 1 per cent) of health spend per capita according to MSF calculations.“This strategy shows that removing out of pocket fees for hospital delivery has a very high return on investment. We call on the government of Lesotho to make delivery free also at hospital level for mothers-to-be across the country, and in doing so help ensure that fewer women and infants die around the time of pregnancy”, says Jesper Hildebrandt Brix, MSF’s project coordinator in Lesotho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women Deliver,26th September 2018,,https://womendeliver.org/how-community-partnerships-prove-essential-in-the-futures-of-young-mothers-in-lesotho/,"The HIV/AIDS pandemic has rendered Lesotho girls vulnerable to teenage pregnancy and early marriages.  Of all pregnancies in Lesotho, 55% are among adolescent girls and young women (20.7% among 15 – 19-year-olds and 34.3% among 20 – 24-year-olds). Of adolescent girls 15 – 19 in Lesotho, 45.9% have had sexual intercourse, of whom one in three has an unmet need of a modern contraceptive method. Butha Buthe and Thaba-Tseka districts report the highest teenage childbearing rates at 25% and 21% respectively and are among the districts with the lowest use of modern contraception. With 25% of people HIV-positive, Lesotho has a significant cohort of youth growing up without parents to teach them basic knowledge about their reproductive health. Early pregnancy among young girls is on the rise and there has been little support, knowledge, or resources to help them live healthy lives with their babies. Five years ago, a Young Mother Support Program was developed for pregnant or lactating new mothers as young as 14 looking for support and information to better care for their children. Local chiefs encouraged pregnant teens and young mothers from their rural villages to participate in weekly community-based support groups to learn about pre- and post-natal care, depression, basic parenting skills, contraceptives, early child development, and prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission. The sessions also encourage peer support, tools for boosting self-esteem, and activities to strengthen their agency and ability to speak up for themselves amid stigmatization, fears and unhealthy myths.  While the girls were becoming more confident and informed, community leaders soon realized a critical gap – the engagement of boys and men. In fact, feedback from one community discussion indicated that many of the participating young girls experienced push back from their boyfriends, husbands, and even family members who felt intimidated by changing power dynamics and the girls’ growing confidence.  In some cases, this led to instances of gender based violence and loss of the agency needed to stand up and speak up for themselves. To address this, project staff quickly determined the need to strengthen community partnerships including with local religious leaders, chiefs, school principals and community councils.  We asked: what is your advice in moving forward and supporting these young mothers? Their advice was unanimous: we had to involve the men – not too much as to overshadow the emphasis on the women but enough so that the men felt included, and were made aware of what actually is discussed during the program so that they didn’t ‘imagine’ the worst. They also suggested that we include the mothers-in-laws, who have substantial social power in families in the Basotho culture.These partnership meetings generated challenging discussions about the rights and needs of girl and women. Events were held where girls shared what they were learning and how they needed the community to support them and their babies. Never before had these girls stood before the community to champion their rights and state their needs. It was life changing – not just for the girls but also for community members and leaders.Overcoming centuries of patriarchy, community leaders began championing the young women. One rural priest said:“The girls who graduate from the program are no longer invisible. They speak up and tell the community what they need and work together to teach our community about gender equity, and we are ready to listen.”Because of this direct involvement in the process, local leaders now feel a sense of pride rather than fear, that these young mothers are part of the positive future of their communities.Engaging and partnering within the community was critical to the success of this program and to providing girls and women with the support they need and deserve. As the dialogue and partnership has continued, community members have come to see that gender equity, HIV prevention, and sexual reproductive health has a ripple effect building trust and benefitting everyone. The program continues holding community meetings and has begun initiating advocacy days at the end of the program to further engage stakeholders at all levels. During these days, there are marches, performances, speeches and rallies which further build confidence and solidarity while also encouraging community and family members to directly and publicly support the young girls.Young Mother Program Officer, Shasha Makhauta, says, “We now have community leaders coming to us to praise these young women and stand up for their rights within their communities. They recommend girls to our program with pride. Partnering with community leaders in such a direct way has really made all the difference.”Change is difficult and as this program demonstrated, community level partnerships may be the key to driving sustainable progress.  Everyone needs to be involved. It does take a village!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United Nations,23rd May 2018,,https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2018/05/committee-rights-child-considers-lesothos-report,"The Committee on the Rights of the Child today concluded its consideration of the second periodic report of Lesotho on how it implements the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Presenting the report, Mokhele Moletsane, Minister of Law and Constitutional Affairs of Lesotho, said that Lesotho had a comprehensive legal framework covering different aspects of child protection, as per provisions of the Convention. Different pieces of legislation that made up that framework were in the custodianship of various ministries in line with their mandates. The Government worked in partnership with civil society and development partners in the provision of services towards the implementation of those frameworks. In 2015, the Government had adopted the National Policy on Social Development 2015-2025, which had identified poverty, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, and food security as the major threats to human wellbeing in Lesotho. The Government had also enacted the Children’s Protection and Welfare Act of 2011 to protect children, promote their welfare, and protect their rights, which included the right to identity, birth registration, life with parents, education and health, social security, protection from labour and torture, and to parental property.In the ensuing discussion, Committee Experts noted many positive developments on the legislative front, such as the passing of the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2010, and the Education Act of 2010.

Other issues raised included corporal punishment, protection of child victims of violence, discrimination against girls in terms of inheritance, birth registration, child statelessness, alternative care institutions for children, adoption, the situation of children in prison with their mothers, children with disabilities, medical exemptions for vulnerable groups of children, availability of medicines, HIV/AIDS prevention, immunization coverage, sustainable nutrition programmes for children, breastfeeding and child friendly hospitals, maternity leave, gender parity in education, treatment of migrant children, repatriation of trafficked children, child labour, domestic work and herding, street children, children in detention, juvenile justice, and the minimum age of criminal responsibility.
In concluding remarks, Benyam Dawit Mezmur, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, expressed hope that the political commitment expressed by the delegation would translate into the implementation of the Committee’s recommendations.On his part, Mr. Moletsane thanked the Committee for its interaction with his delegation, and he reassured the Committee that the Government of Lesotho was committed to upholding the rights of children.Renate Winter, Committee Chairperson, asked the delegation to convey to the children of Lesotho the Committee’s best regards.The delegation of Lesotho included representatives of the Ministry of Law and Constitutional Affairs, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Training, the Ministry of Labour, and the Permanent Mission of Lesotho to the United Nations Office at Geneva.The Committee will next meet in public today at 3 p.m. to consider the combined fifth and sixth periodic report of Norway (CRC/C/NOR/5-6Opens in new window).ReportThe Committee is considering the second periodic report of Lesotho under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/LSO/Q/2Opens in new window).Presentation of the ReportMOKHELE MOLETSANE, Minister of Law and Constitutional Affairs of Lesotho, said that Lesotho had a comprehensive legal framework covering different aspects of child protection, as per provisions of the Convention. The different pieces of legislation that made up that framework were in the custodianship of various ministries in line with their mandates. The Government worked in partnership with civil society and development partners in the provision of services towards the implementation of those frameworks. In 2015, the Government had adopted the National Policy on Social Development 2015-2025, which had identified poverty, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, and food security as the major threats to human wellbeing in Lesotho. The National Policy on Social Development had been adopted to respond to those needs at different points within the human life cycle, with a particular focus on vulnerable and marginalized groups. Vulnerable children included infants, herders, street children, children out of school, and children in conflict with the law. Situations creating vulnerability included child trafficking, forced marriages, early pregnancy, substance abuse, and child abuse. The incidences of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of children were increasing, largely as a result of poverty, food insecurity, and HIV/AIDS. The Constitution of Lesotho of 1993 obliged the State to adopt laws and policies relevant to children and youth such that their protection and wellbeing were guaranteed. The Government had enacted the Children’s Protection and Welfare Act of 2011 to protect children and promote their welfare. The act safeguarded the rights of children and affirmed the responsibility of parents and the State to protect and fulfil those rights. Those included the right to identity, birth registration, life with parents, education and health, social security, protection from labour and torture, and to parental property.The Children’s Protection and Welfare Act of 2011 was complemented by the National Policy on Orphans and Vulnerable Children, which responded to the impact of HIV/AIDS, deepening poverty and food insecurity, and provided the parameters for the care and protection of orphans and vulnerable children. Major economic interventions to improve the welfare of children in Lesotho included the child grants programme that targeted poor households, the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Bursary Programme, and free meals in pre-schools and primary schools. Despite the existence of a comprehensive legal framework, many people could not access basic public services due to the difficult topography. In the face of limited resources and multiple actors in the child protection sector, the Government was faced with weak coordination and deficient monitoring and evaluation. There was a need for a system that was integrated, cost effective and affordable, Mr. Moletsane noted.Questions by Committee ExpertsANN MARIE SKELTON, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, noted many positive developments on the legislative front, such as the passing of the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011, the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2010, and the Education Act of 2010. Ms. Skelton appreciated the candid report by the State party and assured that the dialogue with the Committee would be constructive.As for the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011, had regulations been drafted yet? What gaps had been identified and how would the amendment deal with those gaps? Was the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011 being amended? What was the status of the amendment?Ms. Skelton inquired about the early identification of trafficking cases, namely whether Lesotho could afford different systems for different categories of vulnerable children. Which aspects had been costed and what did the costing show?The coordinating body for children’s rights was the National Coordinating Committee, which had a narrow perspective because it did not encompass a rights-based approach. It focused on protection, Ms. Skelton observed. What about ensuring that the mandate of the oversight committee was made statutory? It was important to separate coordination from oversight. The current Human Rights Commission did not envisage a specific focus on children’s rights. Was there space for one of the commissioners to be appointed on the basis of her or his knowledge of children’s rights?As for social protection, how did the child protection grant work and was it sufficient to solve the problem of malnutrition and stunting?MIKIKO OTANI, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, raised the issue of the definition of the child. Would that definition be unified as any person under the age of 18 in the Constitution, Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011, and the Sexual Offences Act?The Marriage Act of 1974 allowed girls to marry at the age of 16, as well as customary law. Would all relevant laws be amended? Would civil law prevail over customary law? The prevalence of child marriage was 24 per cent. Would it be possible to take a targeted and speedy legislative measure on the prohibition of child marriage by enacting a separate law?Turning to non-discrimination, Ms. Otani reminded that discrimination against girls in terms of inheritance had not been repealed. Did the State party have a concrete plan to start the relevant reform process?On the best interest of the child, Ms. Otani asked whether that principle was implemented in all decisions affecting children, including alternative care and adoption. Was there any information on reports of killings of children with mutilation of their body parts to make medicine? Had any measures been taken to protect children from such crimes?As for the child’s views, Ms. Otani was pleased to note that children had participated in the development of the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011. Were they also participating in its reform? Was the children’s parliament institutionalized with sufficient resources and support, and was it accessible to all children? Did the Government plan to raise awareness and promote respect for the views of the child in the family, school and community?Ms. Otani expressed concern that the law did not explicitly prohibit corporal punishment in all settings, including the family and care and penal institutions. Would the State party consider prohibiting punishment in all settings, and taking measures such as awareness raising to change the mind set of people and to provide training to parents, teachers and others working with children on positive discipline?With respect to abuse, neglect and sexual exploitation, Ms. Otani noted the establishment of the child and gender protection units, but was concerned about serious challenges, such as inadequate capacities, lack of training, and increasing sexual abuse of school girls and girls in domestic work. What kind of prevention measures had been taken or envisaged? Did reporting mechanisms and case referral and processing procedures exist for child abuse, sexual abuse and other forms of violence against children? Was it mandatory for child-related professionals to report child abuse and sexual abuse, and to whom? Was there a national helpline accessible to all children 24 hours? Were community policing activities effective in preventing violence against children?BENYAM DAWIT MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, inquired about a comprehensive assessment of the current birth registration system, which was challenged by the country’s difficult geography. When was the birth registration declared late?What was the extent of child statelessness in Lesotho? Why was the granting of Lesotho citizenship limited to only one generation of those born outside of the country? How had the legal safeguard against child statelessness been used? It seemed that women could not pass on Lesotho nationality to their children. What was the situation with respect to the right of foundlings to Lesotho nationality? Was there a procedure for the reporting of children’s issues in the media?How were births registered in remote areas of the country, an Expert inquired? What happened with nomad children; how were they registered at birth? Was birth registration too expensive for the population? Was the birth certificate a requirement for obtaining nationality?Replies by the DelegationThe delegation confirmed that the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011 did not have regulations. The Government had prioritized making amendments to the act before it made regulations. Given the small size of the country and its limited resources, an integrated approach to early identification of trafficking cases could yield better results. The costing exercise was very comprehensive and it called for the identification of a critical path for the use of limited resources strategically to achieve results.The coordination of children’s rights had always been an issue. Comprehensive structures at different levels were necessary to ensure coordination with a legal basis. Lesotho was in the process of establishing the Human Rights Commission and ensuring that it represented children’s rights. There was still room for different stakeholders to make their input in the Commission, such as representation of children’s rights.REFILOE LITJOBO, Permanent Representative of Lesotho to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained that civil society members were part and parcel of law making in Lesotho. The authorities were still waiting for the additional input of civil society with respect to the Human Rights Commission.The delegation explained that the child protection grant targeted poor families. The Government had reviewed that programme and consulted communities in order to map all families according to their income. But the child protection grant was paid only to very poor families.Training for State officials included issues of child protection, child custody and child representation. Lesotho used to have different child helplines and it had to close down some of them due to the end of donor-driven projects. The current helpline operated only for eight hours daily due to resource limitations. Serious cases were referred to the police and the Ministry of Health.The penalty for late registration of births would be repealed. There were talks between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Home Affairs to reopen some birth registration centres to be run by permanent Government employees. At the moment, birth registration was done by community chiefs. In remote areas, some 60 per cent of school going children were registered in schools. The birth certificate facilitated access to basic services, but it was not required for acquiring nationality.Children above the age of 12 expressed their views about alternative care and adoption, whereas for those below the age of 12 the authorities followed the principle of the best interest of the child.MOKHELE MOLETSANE, Minister of Law and Constitutional Affairs of Lesotho, informed that the Government had recently tabled an amendment on dual citizenship, namely of Lesotho and South Africa. There were bilateral discussions between South Africa and Lesotho on that matter. The two countries had set up a working group to discuss stateless children and unaccompanied minors.The delegation stated that there were more ritual killings of children. The Government was undertaking a study on violence against children, which would inform about the depth of the problem. There was also a crime prevention unit within the police implementing public awareness programmes.Physical abuse (corporal punishment) was part of training programmes for teachers. Every case of violence against children should be reported and sent to the courts. Crime prevention committees dealt with such offences in rural settings. Corporal punishment was prohibited in the juvenile justice system. Mr. Moletsane highlighted the issue of enforcement and change of mind set. A lot needed to be done to raise awareness about the negative effects of corporal punishment.Second Round of Questions by Committee ExpertsMIKIKO OTANI, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, inquired about the Government’s plan to establish alternative care institutions for children. Were there complaint mechanisms for children in such institutions? Did they have sufficient space, and financial and human capacities to accommodate and provide proper care for the children who needed alternative care?What should be done to address child abuse and maltreatment in informal alternative care institutions? Did the law require a court order to place children in alternative care institutions? What measures should be taken to prevent the current practice of placing children in alternative care institutions without a court order?Turning to adoption, Ms. Otani asked about the role that the adoption agency would play. Were the Foster Care and Adoption Policy of 2013 and the Adoption Practice Guidelines and Proceedings implemented? What were the reasons for the long adoption process? Did the Government try to promote domestic adoption and how?What was the situation of children in prison with their mothers? Did judges take into consideration the best interests of the child in deciding the sentence on the mothers or fathers who were caring for children? Did children live in prisons with caregiving parents and were they provided with appropriate facilities and services in prisons?BENYAM DAWIT MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, raised the issue of children’s health and medical exemptions for vulnerable groups of children. Where did the funding for medical exemptions come from?Mr. Mezmur further highlighted insufficient medicine supplies and international cooperation in that regard. With respect to HIV/AIDS, knowledge about HIV/AIDS prevention seemed to be static, and prevalence among adolescent girls and boys seemed to be high. What was the trajectory for reaching 100 per cent of prevention of mother to child transmission? What was the situation of immunization coverage?What progress had been made in gathering disaggregated data on children with disabilities? Mr. Mezmur further inquired about the use of sign language as a way to facilitate access to justice for children with disabilities.He asked about the existence of a sustainable nutrition programmes for children aged below 5, breastfeeding and child friendly hospitals, maternity leave, and the national action plan for water and sanitation.Finally, Mr. Mezmur asked about gender parity in education, efforts to refurbish schools, and the privatization of education.ANN MARIE SKELTON, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, observed that there seemed to be blurring of migrant children and refugee and asylum-seeking children. Did the law make a clear distinction in that regard? Were migrant children accepted in schools? Where were unaccompanied migrant children placed? As it received refugee children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho should have a system for identifying child soldiers and providing them with support.As for child labour, Ms. Skelton said that domestic work and herding of cattle were the two problems which were the most difficult to eliminate, and that little progress had been made in that regard. What had been done to disseminate the 2014 Minimum Employment Guidelines for Shepherds, and had there been any awareness raising programmes?What was the number of street children in Lesotho? Begging was an offence, but that was not the right way to deal with the problem. What programmes were in place to deal with that phenomenon?The statistics on sexual offences against children were very outdated. As for juvenile justice, Ms. Skelton praised Lesotho’s move to a restorative over a punitive approach, and that the minimum age of detention was set at 14. The minimum age of criminal responsibility had been raised from 7 to 10, and there was a plan to further raise it to 12. Ms. Skelton recommended that the age of criminal responsibility be set at 14.What were children learning in approved schools? How many children were in prisons? Did children stay in police stations when detained?Replies by the DelegationIn Lesotho the child was defined as any person below the age of 16. However, persons aged between 16 and 18 received the same protection as children. A legal amendment would stipulate that the child below the age of 18 had no capacity to consent to marriage. That amendment would supersede customary legal practices, especially when it came to child marriage, the delegation explained. Child marriage was a concern for the Government, and the authorities were launching a campaign to end it.The Government aimed to strengthen alternative care centres for children, formalize kinship care, and improve capacity building of care providers. Raising awareness would be directed at communities to inform that care for children would be decided by the courts. The formalization of kinship care would create a lot of work for social workers, but would also protect children from property craving by relatives. In cooperation with UNICEF, the Government was developing a referral mechanism system and standard operating procedure for children who needed alternative care.As for complaint mechanisms in alternative care centres, at the moment there was only monitoring by care givers. The authorities were undertaking a reform of the case management system, and they were planning to collect information about informal alternative care centres. Social workers dealing with children’s issues had been trained on the drafting of court orders, which were necessary for the placement of children in alternative care centres.The role of the adoption agency would be to determine the adoptability of the child, and suitability of prospective parents, as well as to monitor and provide the central authority with annual activity reports. The Government would welcome technical assistance to accelerate the adoption process, which was slow because it was necessary to determine whether the child had no living relatives. It was for the best interest of the child to live with family members.MOKHELE MOLETSANE, Minister of Law and Constitutional Affairs of Lesotho, explained that previous amendments had assisted the authorities in interpreting the definition of the child when there were discrepancies in different legal acts. When courts delivered justice, they would always refer to specialist legislation, namely the Child Protection and Welfare Act of 2011. Lesotho was embarking on constitutional reforms and it was an opportune time for all sectors to take advantage of those reforms.The delegation said that there was one correctional centre in Lesotho where incarcerated breastfeeding mothers were able to feed their infants. The Government was currently constructing a new female correctional centre in order to meet the needs of detained mothers to care for their children.Medical exemptions were part of public assistance in kind offered to vulnerable households or individuals. They were budgeted by the Ministry of Social Development, with collaboration from the Ministry of Health, the delegation explained. The availability of medicines currently stood at 93 per cent, and medical staff were able to order medical supplies through the logistical management information system. The Government had allocated a budget for vaccines and medicines for family planning, but it still depended on donors for the rest of medicines.In terms of HIV/AIDS prevention, the authorities had engaged civil society to reach communities at risk through trainers for comprehensive sexuality education. There were also counsellors for youth and outreach teams of peer educators to identify key populations. The Ministry of Health had adolescent friendly services, which would allow young people to seek health services. Professional nurses worked with traditional healers and community leaders to bring them to hospitals for training on how to perform traditional male circumcision.The immunization coverage stood at 68 per cent in Lesotho and vaccination campaigns were carried out by the Ministry of Health, partners and communities. Vaccine cold storages were available at the central level, and were deemed sufficient. The Government financed most of the vaccines, whereas the rest was provided by the GAVI Alliance. As for water-borne diseases, the Ministry of Health had a department on environmental health, which worked with schools and communities to spread knowledge about the prevention of those diseases.There were shelters for pregnant women, who were advised to visit pre-natal clinics as early as possible to receive a service kit and counselling, as well as to get tested for HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS exposed infants underwent tests until the age of 18 months to confirm that they were not positive. The authorities worked hard to empower HIV/AIDS positive children and adolescents through strengthening clubs for them. There were blood banks in three regions, but there was a shortage of blood donors. Women had to pay for caesarean section, but the fee was low.The teenage pregnancy rate was high and stood at 19 per cent. Nine out of 10 of those girls were married. The Ministry of Health was carrying out a pilot project of pregnancy self-testing for adolescent girls, in addition to awareness raising campaigns. Nutrition corners existed across the country to educate women about how to prepare food at different growth stages of their children.The Government was currently reviewing the Labour Law to introduce a 14 weeks paid maternity leave, and it was campaigning for the ratification of the International Labour Organization Convention No. 103 on maternity protection to encourage mothers to exclusively breastfeed for at least six months. The authorities carried out preparations for baby friendly hospitals.The Government in collaboration with the Lesotho Association of Persons with Disabilities had reached an agreement to provide sign interpretation in courts when there was need. Equally, social services providers would be trained to improve services for persons with disabilities in the justice system. Lesotho had a general social transfer programme, which could be accessed by persons with disabilities. The Government was currently working on introducing a comprehensive package of grants, such as the infant grant, the disability grant, the old-age pension, and labour-related grants, co-financed by the World Bank and the United Nations Children’s Fund.The previous community-based rehabilitation programme for persons with disabilities, supported by the Danish Government, had not yielded results because persons with disabilities had been left to their own devices. The new community development programme would include persons with disabilities in the context of their households and communities.Turning to education, the delegation explained that in most cases boys and girls left school to help their families earn a living, to take care of younger siblings, or due to early pregnancy. Young boys also crossed into South Africa to work in illegal mining. That situation was a serious challenge for the Government. Nevertheless, there were posts across the country to teach reading and writing to boys and girls in the countryside. Teaching and learning was also available through a limited home-based schooling programme.At the same time, pre-school attendance was increasing. The Government was aware that the schools built by churches had dilapidated, which was why it had been constructing schools on an annual basis since 2002. The authorities relied heavily on church schools, even though it was the Ministry of Education that oversaw the implementation of the education policy in these schools, and defined the national school curriculum.As for mental health, the delegation explained that children and adolescents were a priority for the Ministry of Health, but there was a limited number of psychologists to work with child victims of sexual abuse. The Ministry was thus working to train all medical personnel in hospitals to manage child victims accordingly.Turning to climate change, the delegation noted that it negatively affected food production and food security. The Government had launched the “zero hunger” review, which had shown that the private sector with its technology and research was more equipped to address climate change and ensure the availability of food.The Government would collect data on domestic work and herding. A child labour unit had been set up within the Ministry of Labour and it had embarked on several awareness-raising campaigns. District child protection teams had been trained, and child protection community teams would be trained as well.The authorities did not have information about the number of street children. Begging among street children would better be qualified as payment for the work that those children performed. There were programmes for street children to reunite them with their families, the delegation explained. Street children could also benefit from the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Bursary Programme.Detained children were not held in police stations; they were given back to their parents or guardians. The number of children in detention facilities was decreasing, and the Ministry of Justice was planning to reintegrate juvenile offenders through so-called approved schools.As for the repatriation of trafficked children to their countries of origin, the International Organization for Migration was working with the Ministry of Internal Affairs on border management. Some of the expected outcomes were the standard operating procedure for border management and the drafting of memoranda of understanding with transportation companies. Trafficked children were repatriated if they wanted to return to the country of their origin. Otherwise, they were provided with protection in Lesotho. Unaccompanied minors were treated in the same way as refugee or asylum-seeking children. Once registered, they were enrolled in school.Follow-up Questions by Committee ExpertsANN MARIE SKELTON, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, drew the delegation’s attention to the ongoing Global Study on children deprived of liberty and asked the Government of Lesotho to fill in the relevant questionnaire and submit it to the Committee.Concluding RemarksBENYAM DAWIT MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Rapporteur for Lesotho, welcomed the existence of the children’s parliament in Lesotho and the introduction of integrated services for children. He highlighted some challenges, such as dependence on donor funding for some children’s programmes, projects that needed to be rolled out on a bigger scale, and banning of corporal punishment in all settings. Mr. Mezmur expressed hope that the political commitment expressed by the delegation would translate into the implementation of the Committee’s recommendations.MOKHELE MOLETSANE, Minister of Law and Constitutional Affairs of Lesotho, thanked the Committee for its interaction with his delegation, and reassured it that the Government of Lesotho was committed to upholding the rights of children. Mr. Moletsane reaffirmed that the Committee’s concluding observations would be taken seriously by the Government.RENATE WINTER, Committee Chairperson, asked the delegation to convey to the children of Lesotho the Committee’s best regards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pedestric Aids Foundation,August 2022,,https://www.pedaids.org/2022/08/04/fresh-from-the-source/,"Breastfeeding is the best and healthiest feeding option for babies, regardless of the mother’s HIV status. Breast milk contains all the water, food, and nutrients to protect the baby from common infections such as diarrheal infection and it ensures that babies receive vital nutrients that are needed for their growth and development to avoid malnutrition. World Breastfeeding Week is commemorated annually in the first week of August to raise awareness of the importance of breastfeeding. This year’s theme is Step-up for Breastfeeding: Educate and Support.In Lesotho, the Ministry of Health Nutritionist ‘Mahlompho Ntai says that this year’s theme focuses on empowering all stakeholders to protect and support breastfeeding mothers wherever they are. For example, supervisors at workplaces, partners and spouses at home, and parents and in-laws in the community should be equipped with information to provide and sustain breastfeeding-friendly environments.Ntai highlights that among the common challenges of exclusive breastfeeding are low-milk supply from mothers (often due to food insecurity); lack of breastfeeding hours at work; and the situation of young mothers who return to school, leaving their babies with their grannies.Ntai says that during Breastfeeding Week, the Mafeteng District in southwest Lesotho will embark on nutrition education at workplaces and will conduct focus group discussions in communities where there are breastfeeding support groups—to talk to mothers-in-laws, fathers-in-laws, and mothers of child-bearing age about exclusive breastfeeding and its successes and challenges.“The community feedback that will be received from these separate groups will be used to improve interventions to ensure the success of exclusive breastfeeding in the district,” she says.She says that to ensure nutritional education and support at antenatal and postnatal clinics in the facilities, nurses are trained to convey the exclusive breastfeeding education to pregnant and nursing mothers during consultation visits, and can walk clients through potential barriers or concerns.‘Marethabile Mothibi, senior PMTCT advisor with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), says that at health facilities, mothers are always encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their newborn babies for the first six months of life, regardless of their HIV status—which is in line with the national infant and young child feeding guidelines and also embedded in the national guidelines for eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission. Women with HIV continue to take their treatment and have their viral load monitored at the encounter of their pregnancy and every three months thereafter until they are done breastfeeding to ensure they do not pass the virus to their babies.“Apart from being a clinician, I am also a mother of two children, whom have been exclusively breastfed for six months. When I talk to mothers, I also share my living testimony that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable with the support of family members or colleagues. I, therefore, strongly encourage breastfeeding regardless of HIV’s status,” Mothibi says.When I talk to mothers, I also share my living testimony that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable with the support of family members or colleagues.Mothibi says that along with the health benefits of breastfeeding, it is free and it is always warm and ready for the baby at any time, even at night—no need to wake up and prepare it. Breastmilk does not need refrigeration and is always fresh from the source.Another important benefit breastfeeding is that it bonds the mother and her baby. Mothibi says that the bonding extends to the father and the whole family.“At facilities, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are encouraged to bring along their partners or mothers-in-law so that during health education they can also be empowered with information and skills to support nursing mothers during the exclusive breastfeeding period,” she says. Right now, most mothers are opting for breastfeeding because of education provided during antenatal clinics.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Human Rights in Focus,2oth August 2020,Maseru,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/aug/20/fashion-industry-jeans-lesotho-garment-factory-workers-sexual-violence,"At one of the biggest garment factories in Maseru, the capital city of Lesotho, the managers never hired enough regular workers to complete the clothing orders that flooded in from Europe and the US. Instead, every morning, a few hours after the sewing machines had started whirring, a male supervisor would stroll out to the factory gates where dozens of women waited. As he approached, they would surge forward, pressing themselves close to the railings and calling out their names.These women were known as the “dailies” – unemployed cutters and machinists who went from factory to factory looking for a few hours of casual work. Everyone knew what the women had to do to get picked from the crowd. Many would endure repeated harassment and sexual assault to secure a daily wage of just over £6 a day.“A woman whose babies are going hungry will do anything to put food on the table,” said Thebelang Mohapi, who worked in the payroll department. She regarded the women outside the gate with pity and fear: she understood that the invisible line between her and the “dailies” could vanish at the smallest misstep. The supervisors knew they held all the power. “Nobody ever stopped them. They did whatever they wanted to do.”Mohapi, at 23, knew that regular workers were also being forced to have sex with their managers to keep their jobs, but she thought that if she worked hard and kept her head down, she would go unnoticed. When she passed her probation period and her supervisor recommended her for a full-time job, she felt years of stress lift from her shoulders.Then, a few weeks later, just before her shift was due to end, her supervisor came looking for her. He told her to follow him to his office and she watched mutely as he closed the blinds and asked her to shut the door.“At first he tried to say that he’d fallen in love with me and wanted us to be in a relationship. When I said no, he said I had to show him some gratitude,” she said. He became angry and aggressive, shouting and advancing on her in the gloom. Mohapi fled from his office and, shaking, went straight to the head of human resources at the factory to complain that she was being harassed. By the end of the day she had been fired.“Everything changed in an instant,” she said. She and her husband had just rented a small one-bedroom house, and she had dreams of saving up to go to nursing college. Her husband was struggling to support her and their baby daughter; he had worked in the garment factory, rubbing holes in the knees of new pairs of jeans to make them look distressed, but had to quit after he got sick from inhaling denim fibres. “I thought this job was the start of something good for us. I knew of the bad things happening at the factory but I was foolish enough to think it wouldn’t happen to me,” she said.When I met Mohapi in Maseru late last year, she had not worked since the day she was fired, almost 12 months earlier. The factory’s HR manager had put a letter on her file saying she was insolent and insubordinate, and that her work was unsatisfactory. “That letter,” she said, “it has followed me from place to place. I feel angry every day that I was punished and this man is still there, taking home a salary. Nobody cares what is happening to us women there.”Last year, a report by an NGO, the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC), revealed a widespread incidence of rape, sexual assault and harassment at multiple garment factories in Maseru. More than 120 women from three different factories testified that they had been forced to have sex with male supervisors in order to keep their jobs. Some alleged that they had been raped on the factory premises. Some said they had contracted HIV from supervisors who withheld their salaries until they agreed to have unprotected sex. Those who complained were sacked.These factories in Lesotho supply some of the most famous denim brands in the world. The Taiwanese company Nien Hsing, which owns the factories investigated by WRC, is a major supplier to Levi Strauss, Wrangler and US retailer The Children’s Place. The brands had all carried out social audits and factory inspections, which are supposed to detect human rights and labour violations, but none had picked up the degrading and abusive conditions the female workers endured.The WRC report was the first to link major brands directly to sexual violence in Lesotho, but garment workers in India, Brazil, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Turkey, China, Bangladesh and Vietnam have also reported being assaulted, stalked, groped, harassed and raped in factories making clothing for international brands. An ActionAid report in 2019 estimated that 80% of all Bangladeshi garment workers had faced sexual violence in the workplace.“Sexual harassment is the fashion industry’s dirty secret. Brands are rarely called to account for what is happening to women making their clothing,” said Aruna Kashyap, a campaigner and legal advocate for Human Rights Watch.Levi’s initially told WRC that this was an issue for Nien Hsing to resolve. But faced with such clear evidence of a culture of rape and sexual harassment in their supply chain, they decided they couldn’t ignore it. They negotiated a legally binding agreement with Nien Hsing, the owners of five major factories, unions and women’s groups to put measures in place to protect workers, including stopping the use of “dailies” and creating an independent body to investigate allegations of harassment.But these gains are now in jeopardy. “At the beginning of this year we genuinely felt optimistic that what happened in Lesotho would create real change for women across the global fashion industry,” said Scott Nova, the executive director of WRC. “But now the world feels like a very different place.”Covid-19 has hit the global garment industry hard. As the virus kept consumers at home and shuttered high streets, fashion brands responded by using “force majeure” clauses in their contracts with suppliers to cancel an estimated £8bn of orders. Many refused to accept shipments of finished clothing they would no longer be able to sell.The knock-on effect has been swift and brutal: more than 1 million workers have aleady lost their jobs in Bangladesh. Many are already facing destitution. As wages are slashed and factories close, there has been a wave of attacks on labour rights campaigners and vulnerable workers, including pregnant women in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar. Already, the sexual abuse of women garment workers who desperately need jobs is on the rise.“What we are now facing is nothing short of a human rights catastrophe for millions of women,” said Nova. “When we released the Lesotho report, we really felt like we’d found the very worst of what could happen to women workers at the bottom of our supply chains. Now, as workers get more desperate to keep their jobs, they will be less able to speak out.”Compared to the multi-billion pound garment powerhouses of Bangladesh and China, the small, landlocked country of Lesotho, an enclave within South Africa, is an industry minnow, exporting just 90m pieces of clothing a year, compared with the 10bn pieces of clothing exported by Bangladesh each year. Yet one thing that Lesotho specialises in is denim. More than 26m pairs of jeans are made here every year, many of them for Levi’s, and this has become the fuel that keeps the country’s faltering economy running.“Without the garment industry, the economy would just break down,” said Sam Mokhele, from the National Clothing and Textile Workers Union (NACTWU) union in Lesotho. The export garment industry accounts for more than 20% of the country’s GDP. “The Taiwanese clothing companies are now our biggest employer. There are 46,000 people working in the factories, most of them women whose families wouldn’t be able to eat if they closed.”Lesotho’s ready-to-wear apparel industry started in the 90s when Taiwanese and Chinese clothing companies were attracted by the country’s geographical proximity to the roads and ports of South Africa and favourable trading arrangements offered by the government. The Nien Hsing group is one of Levi’s major suppliers.The vast majority – about 80% – of garment workers in Lesotho are female. Women are the main breadwinners for many families in Lesotho, often supporting extended families. Since the factories came to Maseru, the number of women employed in Lesotho has doubled. Yet the garment industry has not delivered the economic emancipation for women that it promised. Most of the women I interviewed in Lesotho last year were paid less per month than the cost of a single pair of Levi’s jeans – about £60. And yet, for many, it is either this or nothing.“At the end of the day, garment workers across the world are stigmatised and marginalised because they are poor women,” said Bobbie Sta Maria, a senior researcher at the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre. “It is overwhelmingly women who do the badly paid, low-skilled manual labour, and almost universally men who are in positions of power over them. The brands benefit from this model and its lower production costs, because they know that women will accept poorly paid work to support their families.”The fashion industry’s fast-moving production model exerts relentless pressure to produce more for less. The burden falls on suppliers in some of the world’s poorest countries, where there is high unemployment and little enforcement of labour and human rights standards. Now, as brands struggle to claw back lost profit from the coronavirus pandemic, that pressure is only likely to get worse.“In March, when the pandemic hit, brands immediately started refusing to pay for orders already in production in factories. Now things are re-opening, we’re seeing retailers expecting to get significant discounts,” said Nova.Mohapi said that even before the pandemic, factory supervisors were always stressed by the constant pressure to hit targets, and often took it out on the women. They would walk up and down the line screaming at them to work harder. It was a process of dehumanisation. “They would abuse us, calling us prostitutes and dogs,” she said. “If we had a big order, it got worse.”Outside the factories, Lesotho has one of the highest rates of rape and sexual violence in the world, and most women do not trust the police. “Inside our factories women didn’t report, because the management didn’t care and the women saw what happened to people like me who did speak out,” said Mohapi. “The people from the WRC were the first to ever ask us what was really happening, and to listen to what we had to say.”Sethelile Ntlhakana had just finished her master’s degree in South Africa in the spring of 2018 when she got a call from WRC about a research job. Ntlhakana’s original brief had nothing to do with sexual harassment. The Nien Hsing group had recently ejected labour unions from all their factories, and WRC was worried that there were pay and health and etyviolations going on behind closed doors.“We set up a whole load of anonymous off-site interviews, and spent hours asking all these questions about pay packets and fire exits, and then – almost as an afterthought – we asked the women what their main problem was at work, and they started talking about their supervisors,” Ntlhakana said. She realised pretty quickly that these were not isolated cases. “Every single person who walked through the door was saying the same thing.”Ntlhakana and a male colleague started focusing almost exclusively on the issue of sexual violence in the factories supplying Levi’s. “Look, I am a Lesotho woman,” she said. “We’ve all been harassed and propositioned in the workplace – but what these women were telling me was another level.” Most of the women had never spoken about their ordeals. Some told Ntlhakana they had contracted HIV from their supervisors, and could not tell their husbands. “It was so hard to deal with that level of trauma and pain,” she said. “Our hearts were broken every single day.”Kabelo Sello is one of the women who spoke to Ntlhakana in early 2019. Sello moved to Maseru in 2018, leaving three young children and an elderly mother waiting for her paycheck. After months of searching for work, she eventually got offered a short-term contract at a Nien Hsing factory, packing Levi’s jeans into boxes. “It was really hard – we had to pack minimum 90 boxes of jeans a day, so it was very stressful,” she told me when we met in downtown Maseru. As Sello’s contract neared its end, her supervisor started propositioning her in the factory and following her home from work at night.Sello understood the transaction he was proposing. In exchange for sex, she would get a permanent job and better conditions at work. “All the time I was thinking about how I needed to support the three children and my mother,” she said quietly. “I did it and I got my job, but I feel very ashamed,” she said. “And he’s still harassing me – I’m still expected to do it whenever he wants.”In Lesotho, I spoke to 10 women working at factories producing jeans for Levi’s and other western brands. One woman, Mamello Makhetha, broke down when she talked about being raped by her boss. She hid her face in her sleeve as she described the smell of his cheap aftershave as he lay on top of her, and how she felt her mind slowly unravelling in the weeks after. “He acted like nothing had happened,” she said. “I realised maybe he has done this to lots of other women. Maybe to him this was just lunchtime recreation, but for me it was like death.”When Makhetha eventually complained, she was demoted and moved to a lower-paid job in another department. “I know what happened to me is wrong, but if I lose this job I won’t get another one, so in the end you just accept that this is the way that life is,” she said.The culture that allows sexual harassment and violence against women is deeply troubling for some of the male workers. Joseph Tlali, a father of four with more than 20 years of experience on the factory floor, is a supervisor at one of the factories exposed by the WRC report. “The supervisors just did what they wanted,” he said. “Even the junior managers were abusing women during their lunchtime. The factory manager would actually be watching them having sex on CCTV, but would not do anything to stop it. It was more like watching porn, you know? I would go home and look at my daughters sleeping and think: ‘You will never work in one of these places.’”The solution, Tlali said, had to start with fair pay. “The [women] need to be paid more, so that they feel they have a choice, and are not constantly just days away from destitution.”. He said the Taiwanese bosses didn’t care about how the supervisors were treating the women as long as they completed the orders, and the brands didn’t care as long as they got their clothes. “Nothing was done to keep the women safe,” he said. “They couldn’t tell their husbands because they thought they would be blamed. So really, they were completely on their own.”Levi Strauss & Co is celebrated across the industry for its ethical procurement, and was one of the first fashion brands to demand that suppliers uphold human rights and labour standards. Yet its supply chains in Lesotho had still become infested with sexual violence. As one campaigner put it to me: “If it’s happening in Levi’s supply chain, then it’s happening everywhere.” While every retailer has its own approach to ethical procurement, most, including Levi’s, use factory inspections and social auditing to show they are taking active steps to police the implementation of their codes of conduct.The fashion industry started relying on social audits after the damaging sweatshop exposés of the 90s, which revealed the exploitation of workers making goods for global brands such as Nike and Gap. But for years campaigners have been warning that codes of conduct and social audits not only don’t work, but can be misleading. By creating a veneer of corporate accountability, they allow brands to palm off responsibility for bad working conditions on to suppliers.“These audits are not there to protect the worker – they are there to protect the reputation of the clothing companies,” said Aruna Kashyap of Human Rights Watch. Kashyap recalls disasters that led to garment workers losing their lives in unsafe buildings: in 2012, the Ali Enterprises factory fire in Pakistan killed 250 workers who were trapped behind barred windows. In 2013, in the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, a factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring thousands more. “In both cases these factories had been declared safe by corporate social audits shortly before disaster struck. If audits can’t pick up that a building is about to collapse then there is no way they could identify something as hidden and nuanced as gender-based violence,” Kashyap said. Regardless, when it comes to sexual harassment, fashion brands are not even asking the questions. “They simply don’t want to know.”All of the factories named in the WRC report had been audited and inspected, and no problems had been found. The women I talked to in confidence, on condition of anonymity – who also complained of unsafe working conditions and problems with pay and targeting of union organisers – had all been on the factory floor when audits were being carried out. They all said they would never disclose any problems they were having to auditors, especially not sexual harassment.“When the inspectors come, they only ever talk to us in groups, and usually in front of our managers,” said Kabelo Sello. “Even if they talk to us alone, the management is watching, so if there is a complaint afterwards they know who who has talked. They never ask us any questions – they only say, “Are you happy at work?”, and we all nod.”I asked Levi’s why their social audits had failed to pick up any of the abuse that had been uncovered by the WRC researchers. Kim Almedia, director of Levi’s “worker wellbeing” programme, said: “Gender-based violence is a complicated issue and is very hard to detect in the workplace,” she said. “I think this is a very specific incident that happened at one supplier with very specific conditions.”Levi’s has said it intends to create women-led teams to do the audits. However, Ntlhakana, who interviewed many of the garment workers, said that brands have to gain the trust of women who will be scared to speak out. “We’re a relatively small NGO, and we just hired a hotel room away from the factory floor and asked workers if they wanted to come and speak to us. You have to create the conditions in which women feel safe to talk.”When WRC first put the women’s allegations to the management at Nien Hsing, they denied it all. “They said that no cases of sexual harassment or abuse had been reported for two years, and that no manager or supervisor had been disciplined for sexual harassment since 2005,” said Rola Abimourched, the lead campaigner on the Lesotho campaign. “Which was exactly the point the women had been making – there was no safe way for them to report.”Levi’s worked with Nien Hsing, the local labour unions and women’s rights groups to improve conditions for women in the factories. “For us this was a huge moment, because before it would be unthinkable that international brands would sit at the same table as a local labour union,” said Sam Mokhele, from the NACTWU union in Lesotho.Out of these negotiations came the Lesotho Agreement, hailed by campaigners as the first credible attempt to tackle gender-based violence in the garment industry. Nien Hsing has agreed, among other measures, to implement a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment, recognise the labour unions, hire more female supervisors and put all workers on official contracts. An independent body with full-time staff has been set up to investigate complaints of sexual harassment, which has the power to dismiss perpetrators. If Nien Hsing fails to honour any of these conditions, it will lose its contracts with Levi’s and the other brands.“We strive to ensure a safe and secure workplace for all workers in our factories and are therefore fully committed to implementing this agreement immediately, comprehensively, and with measurable success,” said Richard Chen, the chair of Nien Hsing, at the launch of the agreement.Levi Strauss & Co, The Children’s Place and Kontoor Brands (owners of Wrangler) jointly stated: “We are committed to working to protect workers’ rights and foster well-being at third party supplier factories, so that all workers at these facilities, especially female workers, feel safe, valued and empowered … We believe this multi-faceted program can create lasting change and better working environments at these factories, making a significant positive impact on the entire workforce.”The unions told me before lockdown that things have already dramatically changed for the women at the factories that signed up to the agreement. “Before, it has always been the workers who are desperate. Now it is the factories who are desperate not to lose the brands,” said Mokhele. “The power dynamic has shifted dramatically back to the workers. The supervisors can no longer touch them.”Mamello Makhetha and Kabelo Sello, two of the women who faced sexual assault at the hands of their male supervisors, agree that the factories feel safer. “Everyone is on proper contracts now,” said Sello. “And a lot of the harassment has stopped.”What happened in Lesotho has, said Levi’s senior programme manager, Kim Almedia, been a “huge learning curve” for the brand. She said Levi’s is proud to have been part of the creation of the “groundbreaking” Lesotho Agreement. As a brand, Levi’s is, she said, dedicated to the wellbeing of the women working in its supply chain. “We recognise that 70-80% of our workers are women, and given the power imbalances that exist, this leads to issues,” she said. “The global awakening around #MeToo is an opportunity to seize this moment and use it as momentum to be a leader in this space. It has taken a while for the [garment] industry to wake up to the severity of the issue [of sexual violence], but now there is no time to waste in addressing it.”The Lesotho Agreement had only just started being implemented when the pandemic hit. One of the factories named in the WRC report has closed, but the unions have managed to negotiate unprecedented exit packages for workers and the management has promised to rehire as soon as the orders resume.“We’re standing on the brink of a potential catastrophe in worker’s rights, as brands and suppliers try and recoup the losses they’ve incurred throughout the pandemic,” said Abimourched. “When women in our global supply chains are already suffering increasing suppression and desperation, Lesotho offers a model of how to build back better.”But the impact the agreement will have outside of the handful of Nien Hsing factories in Lesotho may be limited. To date, the agreement is the fashion industry’s one and only attempt to stop the sexual abuse of garment workers. Levi’s says it has no plans to roll out similar initiatives across the rest of its supply chain. Not one perpetrator has faced criminal charges for sexual assaults committed at the factories.“What has happened because of the women at the Nien Hsing factories coming forward and speaking out is incredible, but it’s painful to know that just down the road women in other garment factories are facing the same harassment. With Covid, the situation now in Lesotho is just getting worse for women every day,” said Sethelile Ntlhakana. “There are more than 45,000 garment workers in Lesotho, and more than 40 million more across the world. Each act of sexual violence that they face is a crime and must be stopped.”unhappy fairtrade BananaIs fair trade finished?ead moreJust before lockdown, I spoke to Thebelang Mohapi by phone from Lesotho, and she told me how her life had changed since the WRC report came out. When she saw what the women at her factory had managed to achieve for themselves and thousands of others, she took her case to an employment tribunal, and got her job back. Now she is training to be a union representative at her factory.“It is still hard,” she said, “but at least here in Lesotho everybody is listening to us now. I want to try and make sure that no other woman in the factories has to come to work and suffer like that again.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NSWP - Global Network Of Sex Work Projects ,2020,,https://www.nswp.org/featured/key-affected-populations-alliance-lesotho-kapal,"Key Affected Populations Alliance of Lesotho (KAPAL) advocate for the human rights and health rights of sex workers in Lesotho. They aim to build a sustainable movement that fights for legalisation of sex work while also advocating for the rights of key populations – sex workers and LGBTQI groups – through advocacy, capacity building and empowerment. Tell us about your organisationKey Affected Populations Alliance of Lesotho (KAPAL) is the first and the only sex worker organisation legally registered in Lesotho. The organisation is sex worker-led and that means 80% of decision-makers are current and former sex workers. The key objectives of the organisation include sensitisation of communities, government institutes and ministries, relevant stakeholders and gatekeepers; advocacy for legalisation of sex work and inclusion of sex work in the labour statutes; fighting stigma and discrimination against sex workers; fighting violence against sex workers; advocating for the human rights and health rights of sex workers; and providing support to and assisting sex workers and particularly those who have fallen victim of abuse, violence and discrimination on the basis of their work.Mission Statement: To build a sustainable movement that fights for legalisation of sex work while also advocating for the rights of key populations – sex workers and LGBTQI groups – through advocacy, capacity building and empowerment.Vision: To become the leading organisation in fighting for inclusive rights of key populations and marginalised groups while also creating conducive environment for their equal access of health services and social services.                                                                                      
What is the history of the organisation? How and why was it formed?The organisation was established in 2016 after a group of sex workers voiced their weariness over attending different meetings and workshops from different organisations which claim that they fight for the rights of sex workers while they were not engaging them in research, strategic planning, implementation and evaluation of programs which are supposed to benefit them as sex workers. Through a network of African Sex workers Alliance (ASWA) members at the HIV workshop in South-Africa, four of them had a chance to attend a one week 2016 Sex Workers Academy training in Kenya, supported by ASWA. They came back inspired and motivated by different sex workers organisation they encountered on their trip and during the training.There was a consultation process with experts in law, governance, health etc. as a way to establish the unique movement that is led by sex workers and that represents the interests and the views of sex workers. The idea was to utilise the current and existing diverse skills within the then founding members and offer free counselling sessions, HIV and AIDS education, HIV testing, referrals and paralegal services to the sex worker community.As sex workers around the world face stigma and discrimination; KAPAL aims to use sex workers to provide services to the fellow sex workers. This conducive environment created by this initiative has already yielded fruitful results as more and more sex workers are beginning to open up and access the above-mentioned services. Currently the constitution of Lesotho is silent about sex work in Lesotho except for the Penal Code Act 2010, under section 55, that criminalises ""prostitution"". In short, there is no legislation that directly criminalises sex work. This means that it is neither legal nor illegal. However, the state through its police institutions arbitrarily arrest sex workers without any intention of trial due to lack of supporting laws. As a consequence, it makes it easier for clients, police and criminals to rape, abduct, harass, assault, traffic and violate sex workers.Due to the absence of law and human rights protection mechanisms, sex workers work in harsh and poor conditions including cold nights, dirty streets and unsafe bars in an effort to evade arbitrary arrests and violations of their human rights. As a consequence, the above mentioned undesirable conditions make it easier for clients, criminals and members of the law enforcement agencies to rape and violate them.With the continued stigma and discrimination, some sex workers are still struggling to access sexual and reproductive health services and HIV services freely. However, through different initiatives from relevant partners and stakeholders, sensitisation and capacity building programs targeted at health professionals are beginning to yield fruitful results.Due to the fact that the majority of people in Lesotho believe in Christianity and cultural norms, morality is used as a stigma tool to violate the rights of sex workers. More often than not, sex workers are seen as carriers of HIV, the root cause of adultery, and pollution in the city as a few examples. Unfortunately society turns a blind eye to the fact that sex workers engage in sexual activities with clients and blame cannot be diverted to them alone.Finally, there is lack of domestic funding for programs meant to empower sex worker organisations or sex workers directly. Instead, funding goes to implementing organisation which provide services to sex workers and such funding goes with terms and conditions which do not include the voices of sex workers. Do you do political work, or campaigns? What kind?We collaborate with different partners in cross-cutting issues involving the rights of sex workers. We support annual sex worker pride, gay pride, and other key activities raising awareness about the existence of key populations and the need for their equal protection and respect for their human rights.We are currently planning a huge campaign which will raise awareness about police brutality and violence against sex workers, despite being breadwinners, taxpayers, and voters in the democratic country called Lesotho.  KAPAL is sex worker-led and that means 80% of decision-makers are current and former sex workers. Some sex workers are members of the board while some are part of the organisational structure. We also have some sex workers who are volunteers and particularly those who do peer outreach work.Tell us about a big event or challenge you have worked on recently. For example, a campaign, a big event you worked on, etc. How did it go? What were the challenges?On the 29th of August 2020 we donated food parcels to 12 sex workers and rent contributions to 12 sex workers. In addition we gave them masks, condoms, lubricants and HIV Self Tests. This was made possible by the small grant that we received from Frontline AIDS. We wanted to help as many as 2,000 sex workers around the country but unfortunately the grant was reduced to accommodate other sex worker organizations around the world, whose members were also affected by COVID-19.We managed to do a small health talk session and through it we realised that some of the new sex workers are not aware of their human rights, free sexual and reproductive health services and HIV services. Furthermore, we discovered that some sex workers form part of the homeless population and to them their urgent basic need was shelter. Lastly, we realised that most funders dictate terms and conditions of the funding while on the contrary the sex workers feel that there is a need for every funder to first assess their needs and let them to select their own priorities as “nothing for sex workers without the input of sex workers”.What challenges does your organisation face in the future?Limited or zero funding due to increasing challenges engineered by COVID-19.lack of sustainable resources to cover the increasing populations of sex workers and the increasing challenges faced by sex workers on the streets.
Resistance from society and the government as the organisation fully fights for legalisation of sex work.The growing stigma and discrimination as people believe that sex work promotes “human trafficking, prostitution and adultery”. As the leading sex workers rights organisation, we have finally built a “Nothing for us without us” movement which was established by sex workers to meet the demands of and the interests of sex workers. Our ultimate hope is that we will overcome stigma and discrimination through our intensified implementation strategy. We need the voice of everyone as we engage in a dialogue of legalisation of sex work in Lesotho.As for the people outside the movement, we need you to understand that violence against women starts the day we let men rape and violate sex workers and it will end the day governments realise that there is a need to legalise sex work as every man will learn to treat every woman with equal dignity or face jail. As sex work involves transactional sex, most you are not even aware that you engage in sex work every day through receiving money or material gifts. Stigma and discrimination can end only if we all understand that we have someone that we love in the sex worker industry and that someone cannot open up to us because of the stigma and discrimination that we show to them.It is sad to note that every election year sex workers vote for new governments or fresh mandates and policies, with the hope that their honourable job will be legalised. However, every new government forgets about them once they are in power and yet they will never reject their votes and taxes.Lastly, let us all remember that sex work pays bills and it also sends kids to school. Moreover it pays offerings in church, government taxes, accommodation and the list is endless. Some of you are in business but you are not aware that the majority of your customers are sex workers. We must all respect sex workers and let us make it our duty to break the silence and speak publicly about the need to legalise sex work in Lesotho.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is for foreign police forces to decide whether to investigate a crime in their jurisdiction and they may not take action. You can report the crime to the UK police even if you are not seeking an investigation abroad. The UK police can offer you access to victim support in the UK. They may still send some details of the crime to police in Lesotho. This might be necessary in order to protect vulnerable people, or to stop more crimes being committed.See Rape and Sexual Assault: Returning to the UK after rape or sexual assault abroad for more information. Reporting the crime in Lesotho: what happens next If you choose to report the crime, try to do so as soon as possible, so forensic evidence can be retained. Washing yourself or your clothes may make it difficult for the police to obtain forensic evidence. If you change your clothes, consider taking the clothes you were wearing at the time of the attack when you make a report. You may wish to preserve evidence by retaining items such as condoms, toothbrushes, or text messages. 
You will be asked to make a statement about the incident including a description of the attacker.The police will keep any clothes or electronic equipment which may be evidence of your attack to present to a forensic examiner.The police will assist you with completing the sexual offense enquiry form (titled LMPS120). This form is also filled in by the medical practitioner who will examine you. This form is very important in Lesotho’s legal system because medical doctors are the only people who can give medical evidence in court. Once the case is lodged with the police and an investigation has been opened, a legally trained prosecutor will be appointed to represent you.
The medical examination: what to expectAll public and private hospitals and medical centres can provide essential services for victims of rape and sexual assault, however only public hospitals can gather evidence that is admissible in court. If you want to make a police report, it is recommended that you go to a public hospital. See our list of medical facilities.Private medical centres can only provide essential pre-examination services like providing PEP medication to prevent HIV infection, emergency contraception such as the morning after pill, taking swabs for medical examination and other related medical services.According to Sexual Offences Act of 2003, medical staff are obliged to report sexual offences where there is a child involved. However, if you are an adult, there is no obligation for medical staff to file a criminal report. However, you will be given all the information needed to make a criminal report.A doctor will carry out the examination with a female member of the medical staff present. This examination involves checks for internal injuries, swabs, DNA tests, HIV and STD tests. If deemed necessary for evidence, the doctor may take photographs of visible injuries.After the medical check is complete and doctors have completed the form, you will need to take the form to the police (Child and Gender Protection Unit) for them to open a case.Treatment It is important to remember that all essential health services are available even if you do not intend on making a criminal report.HIV infection rates in Lesotho are high. HIV PEP medication is available at all health facilities. Hospital medical staff will give advice on HIV PEP medication. HIV PEP medication needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. The NHS may be able to commence or continue the 28-day treatment on your return to the UK. Emergency contraception such as the morning after pill is available at government hospitals and clinics for free. It can also be purchased from local pharmacies. Emergency contraception needs to be taken within 72 hours of the incident for it to be effective. Treatment for sexual offences at government hospitals and clinics is free of charge. If you have had medication administered abroad, you should keep the label or make a note of the name of the medication, so that you let your local health provider know when you return home to the UK. Police investigations in Lesotho: what to expect  if a suspect is brought to the police station, you will be asked to identify the perpetrator, and may need to participate in an identification parade. When the police make an arrest, they will take the suspect before the magistrate to hear their charges. A court appearance may only happen when there is enough evidence to proceed with prosecution. How quickly the court proceedings progress will depend on the complexity of the crime. In instances where the suspect is not caught or identified, the case may go on for months or even years. However, where cases are straightforward and there is strong and reliable evidence, a trial date is normally agreed within 1 to 2 months. However, exact timing depends on the availability of the court and the volume of cases in the criminal justice system at the time. Magistrate courts close on public holidays, but do not close for recess. After the first reading of the charges, the suspect will either be remanded in custody or released on bail. An initial statement is made with the police, however a prosecutor may require additional information from you to strengthen the case. Additional information is normally shared with the prosecutor and police. If you wish to pursue prosecution, it is recommended that you first open a criminal case with police before leaving Lesotho. It is important to note that you would normally be required on the first day of the trial as a witness. Witnesses can only give evidence in person, and there is no provision for providing evidence virtually in the Magistrate’s court. It is recommended that you seek advice from your lawyer, the prosecutor or the Child and Gender Protection Unit (CGPU) to see whether a special arrangement can be made, and to understand what leaving Lesotho might mean for your case. Court procedures: what to expect When a suspect is ordered to trial, you will be expected to testify in court. On the first day of trial, you may be asked to give an account of the incident. The norm is to attend court in-person to provide evidence.  The prosecutor and the investigating officer have an obligation to keep you informed. Depending on who wishes to lead contact with you, it may be either the prosecutor or the investigating officer. You are entitled to seek updates on your case. Consular staff can also seek updates on your behalf. If the case pauses pending further investigation, you may have to give an additional statement. You may be asked to provide this to the prosecutor or the investigating officer. You may drop the charges at any time after filing and you will not face charges for doing so. Despite the case being led by the state prosecution, if you wish not to proceed, the case will be dropped after consultation and consent from you. Charges cannot be dropped if you are under 18. On rare occasions, foll wing charges being dropped, the suspect may wish to press charges against the victim alleging malicious prosecution and false accusations, if they have justifiable reasons to do so. The court can order the offender to pay compensation for any injuries or losses, either after they have been convicted or as a result of civil claim.Trial All the required information will be gathered by the investigating officer when they take the statement, including any additional information or evidence that may be collected at the scene of the crime. Trial procedures The police and prosecutor will advise you on court dates once they have all necessary evidence to proceed with the case to go to court. The official languages in Lesotho for triall proceedings are English and Sesotho. You are required to be present on the first day of the trial to give evidence in court. Sexual offence cases are heard in an open court room. If you have to travel to Lesotho to attend the trial, all the costs associated with travel and accommodation should be paid by you. How fast a case will come to trial is dependent on the completion of the investigation and arrest of the perpetrator. Trials are likely to take place across multiple hearings depending on availability of witnesses and the Magistrate assigned to the case. Cases involving sexual offences are usually given priority over other criminal cases. The duration of trials depends on the complexity of the case, availability of witnesses and number of cases within the criminal justice system at the time. For instance, from the first day of trial a case can typically take up to one month if all evidence is at hand and witnesses are available for providing evidence in court. However, it can also take longer, depending on the complexity of the case. Sentences In sexual offences cases, sentencing will take place promptly after the completion of the trial. The Magistrate may take a few days to consider the evidence presented in court before making a judgement in a separate hearing. Appeals The defendant has the right to appeal. There are two opportunities for submitting appeal. Appeals can be made from the Magistrate to the High Court, and then from the High Court to the Court of Appeal. Hiring a lawyer A privately-hired lawyer can perform the role of private prosecutor. However, whilst a case is being handled by public prosecutor, a private lawyer will not have access to the case unless you make an application with the director of public prosecutions. You should speak to a lawyer if you wish to choose this option. See contact details of English speaking lawyers in Lesotho. Some lawyers specialise in rape and sexual assault cases . If application for a privately appointed lawyer is approved, the police are legally obliged to hand over evidence and documents to the lawyer. At this point, the lawyer would replace the state prosecutor. Appointing an independent lawyer will be at your own expense and you may incur costs for services rendered before the case goes to court. Communication At the time of reporting and investigation, the police will communicate with you. Once the case has been handed to the prosecutor, you will communicate with the prosecutor. Ideally, when a sexual offence has occurred, you must be available in person to attend court to provide evidence as and when required. However, if you are not a resident and have to leave the country, the case’s hearing cannot continue if key evidence has not been presented in court. 
If you have given evidence in court and have been cross-examined by the defence, you no longer have an active role in the court and may leave Lesotho whilst the case continues. The investigating officer will then become responsible for keeping you informed of progress. Legal aid For sexual offence cases, a prosecutor is assigned and therefore legal aid is not necessary. Sentencing For rape, a guilty verdict carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. In some cases, such as where the perpetrator pleads guilty, sentencing takes place at the time of the verdict. In more complex cases where deliberation is needed, the judge may defer the sentencing to a later date. Perpetrators who commit sexual offences of any kind can be sentenced under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the Penal Code 2011 and the Human Trafficking Act 2010. Compensation Criminal courts do not order offenders to pay fines for cases of sexual violence. However, action can be taken in a civil claims court, once the perpetrator has been convicted. The Lesotho government does not have a state-funded compensation scheme to compensate for physical or psychological injuries suffered as a result of a sexual or violent crime. When you return to the UK You may want to let your GP or a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) know what has happened to you so that you can talk about the experience and seek further support and advice where you live.If you believe you may be at risk of having contracted a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should ask your local health provider to test you. You should do this even if you have been tested in the country that the assault took place in. It is your choice to let people know. If you are ready to talk about it, these organisations may be able to help you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
International Commission of Jurists,18th October 2022,,https://www.icj.org/lesotho-chief-justice-sakoane-sakoane-calls-for-the-cultivation-of-an-lgbtiq-sensitive-culture-in-lesotho/,"In partnership with OutRight Action International, a leading advocacy organization for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTIQ) people, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) held a workshop to engage the Lesotho judiciary on the human rights of LGBT individuals in the country. In particular, the workshop unpacked how the judiciary could be a key role player in ensuring that the human rights of LGBTIQ persons are upheld. In his opening remarks, which the ICJ publishes today, Lesotho’s Chief Justice, Sakoane Sakoane, summarized key legal developments in the protection of the human rights of LGBTIQ people, and emphasized the importance of ensuring access to justice for marginalized communities in Africa, including LGBTIQ persons. Calling for the “cultivation of an LGBTIQ sensitive culture”, the Chief Justice noted that “in this Kingdom of Lesotho, the LGBTIQ community factually exists as part of society”. He mentioned, however, that
“there is no local jurisprudence yet on what these rights mean for the LGBTIQ community”, even though the Constitution “guarantees two important rights: the right to respect for private and family life (in section 11) and freedom from discrimination (in section 18)”. Reacting to the comments of the Chief Justice, Giselle Ratalane of The People’s Matrix, a local LGBTIQ advocacy group, noted: “Lesotho needs robust and clear legislation that protects minority interests so that human rights violations against [LGBTIQ persons] are correctly indexed in national records. As it currently stands, we are unable to discern human rights violations targeted at LGBTIQ groups as they are not legally recognized in domestic law in Lesotho.”  “Our interaction with the Lesotho judiciary has reinforced our view that there is a need for such legislation, which would empower judges so that they can execute their duties without discrimination or discriminatory impact as they are dictated by the law to carry out their duties.” Building on Ratalane’s comments, Khanyo Farise, Africa Advocacy Officer at Outright International, commented that: “The Lesotho judiciary’s active engagement with and on human rights and LGBTIQ people is an important activity towards ensuring the full enjoyment of a range example to other judiciaries in Africa and around the world.” “Judges and judicial officers play an important part in ensuring access to justice for LGBTIQ+ people, but also have an important role in producing judgments which can advance their human rights.”The ICJ is encouraged by these developments, including, in particular, the willingness of members of the judiciary in Lesotho to understand the plight of many LGBTIQ persons, as well as the relevance and applicability of international human rights principles to their predicaments. “LGBTIQ persons in Lesotho, as elsewhere, continue to be subjected to harassment, discrimination, abuse and violence on the basis of their real or imputed sexual orientation and gender identity.” said Mulesa Lumina, ICJ Africa Communications and Legal Officer. “We will continue working with partners, such as the People’s Matrix and Outright International, to ensure the enforcement of Lesotho’s obligations under international human rights law, which entitle LGBTIQ persons to the full range of human rights without discrimination”, she concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medicines Sans Frontireers ,5th June 2013,Mountain Kingdom,https://www.msf.org/lesotho-maternal-mortality-mountain-kingdom,"Imagine you are nine months pregnant, ready to give birth. You feel your contractions start. You are excited and afraid at the same time but mostly you are in pain and you pray that everything will go well. Now imagine it will take you two, three, four hours or longer, to reach the nearest health facility where you can get an assisted delivery. Imagine mountainous terrain and a journey mostly on foot.What sounds like anyone’s worst nightmare is a reality for many women in Lesotho. Mantebaleng Ntelekoa, a young mother from a rural area in the Lesotho mountains, remembers: “For all of my three deliveries, I walked two hours to the main road and then continued by minibus to the hospital.“I usually started walking when my contractions started and it took a long time, because I had to sit down every time I had a contraction. One of my children was born premature at seven months, so I am glad I made it to the hospital.” But not everyone is as lucky as Mantebaleng. High numbers of people with HIV and poor access to maternity services has lead Lesotho to suffer one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world at 620 deaths per 100,000 live births – representing about twice the global average.More than 50 percent of those deaths are attributed to HIV-related complications. The government of Lesotho has set a target to reduce maternal deaths to 300 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015, and is working on an accelerated action plan to reach the far-off Millennium Development Goal for Maternal Health.Yet, at present, the health situation for many expectant mothers in the small southern African mountain kingdom remains uncertain.Mortality rates in very rural and isolated areas are particularly high. Long distances to the nearest health centre, lack of transport, often impassable terrain in the winter season, as well as user fees charged at major hospitals keep many women from accessing antenatal care, lifesaving HIV treatments as well as services for the prevention of mother to child nsmission of HIV.The Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) team in Lesotho is supporting rural health facilities to ensure that more women from remote areas have access to antenatal services and safe deliveries.A doctor, a midwife and several nurses are supporting health facilities in 10 different locations across the districts of Roma and Semonkong.At St Leonard clinic in Semonkong, there is a small maternity ward and a mothers’ waiting lodge, allowing expecting mothers to come there close to their due date, ensuring they will be able to deliver their babies with the assistance of a trained midwife. New mothers may then stay after giving birth until they are ready to return home with their newborn.“I sleep in the waiting lodge with the mothers when I am in Semonkong, and the atmosphere is quite amazing,” says MSF midwife Marleen Dermaut. “There is a lot of chatting and giggling, the women feel safe and enjoy each others’ company.“After all, they are all in the same position, experiencing the wonder of new life and, away from their duties for a couple of days, are being able to just focusing on themselves and their new babies.”On average, there are six women at the facility at all times. Since last year, the number of assisted deliveries at St Leonard almost tripled from seven to 20 deliveries per month. Likely, this is due to a combination of increased health promotion by health centre staff in the area and MSF’s donation of an ambulance.“The ambulance takes women to the hospital in case of emergencies during labour or after delivery. The hospital is still a two-hour drive away from St Leonard, which can be a long time in an emergency situation. In fact, it already happened that a baby was born in the ambulance,” says Dermaut.Additionally to the specific support of maternity services in Lesotho, a team of MSF health promoters is going out into communities regularly to test people for HIV and tuberculosis (TB) and to improve health education in remote areas.In places with high rates of HIV and TB, this first step is crucial so people understand how to spot the diseases, test for them and be able to start treatment right away if necessary. To reach as many people as possible and to directly involve people living in these areas, MSF trains lay people in communities or “community health workers,” how to test for HIV and when to refer community members to a health facility.“The motivation of many people we work with, be it nurses or community counsellors, and the willingness to make changes definitely makes my work here even more rewarding,” says Dermaut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medicines Sans Frontireers ,3rd November 2015,,https://www.msf.org/lesotho-free-maternal-care-has-impressive-return-investment,"JOHANNESBURG/MASERU – The introduction of free deliveries at a hospital in Lesotho, the country with one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world, drastically reduced maternal deaths during labour and delivery, making the intervention a cheap and highly effective public health measure, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Tuesday.The number of women giving birth in the Roma hospital increased by 45 per cent within a year after MSF offered to cover all their expenses. This shows that fees are a huge barrier in preventing women from seeking medical help for delivery in a country where up to 40 per cent of women give birth at home without the help of a skilled attendant.“Giving life shouldn’t cost a life. But in Lesotho, delivering a baby has either a financial cost for the mother, or a dramatically high human cost for the society. Free maternal health care at both health centre and hospital level is a simple and relatively cheap measure with a huge return on investment in terms of public health”, says Dr Amir Shroufi, MSF deputy medical coordinator for South Africa and Lesotho.According to the World Bank Lesotho has one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world with estimates ranging anywhere from 600 to 1,200 deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal death in Lesotho is frequently due to complications around delivery that can be handled at hospital level: 34% due to sepsis, 20% due to post-abortion complication, 14% due to obstructed or prolonged labour and 12% due to eclampsia.Hospital fees for delivery cost as little as $10 per birth for each woman, but this fee can represent up to a month’s salary for rural people in Lesotho. The introduction of free maternal care in the country would only amount to a tiny fraction (less than 1 per cent) of health spend per capita according to MSF calculations.“This strategy shows that removing out of pocket fees for hospital delivery has a very high return on investment. We call on the government of Lesotho to make delivery free also at hospital level for mothers-to-be across the country, and in doing so help ensure that fewer women and infants die around the time of pregnancy”, says Jesper Hildebrandt Brix, MSF’s project coordinator in Lesotho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The funeral director will tell you what the letter needs to include. You, or the funeral director, will also need to complete ‘Form D’ and have an appointment with the registration officer. If the death was unnatural, a post-mortem will be needed before the cause of death can be recorded. The death certificate and a burial permit (if applicable) will be issued in English. You do not need to register the death in the UK. The local death certificate can usually be used in the UK for most purposes, including probate. If you wish, you can register the death with the Overseas Registration Unit (ORU). You can buy a UK-style death certificate, known as a Consular Death Registration certificate. The ORU will send a record to the General RegisterOffice within 12 months. If the person who died suffered from an infectious condition, such as hepatitis or HIV, you must tell the local authorities, so they can take precautions against infection. Dealing with a local post-mortem in Lesotho, post-mortems are performed when the cause of death is unknown, unnatural, sudden or violent. Post-mortems are carried out by state pathologists appointed by the Ministry of Health. Cultural or religious sensitivities may not be taken into account. The FCDO cannot stop or interfere with the process. During a post-mortem, small tissue samples and organs may be removed and retained for testing without the consent of the family. You will not automatically be told if this happens.If a post-mortem was carried out in the country where the person died, you can ask for a copy of the report by contacting one of the following: your local UK coroner if you bring the body back to the UK the British High Commission in Lesotho the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in the UK If you bring the body back to the UK, the UK coroner will automatically assume responsibility and open an inquest.

Repatriation is the process of bringing the body home. If so, they will make all the necessary arrangements. If the person who died is not covered by insurance, you may need to appoint an international funeral director yourself. There are no airlines currently operating repatriation services from Lesotho. The body must be taken by hearse to the Oliver Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa. A commercial airline will then fly the body to the UK. The funeral director will make the necessary arrangements and will request a supporting letter from the next of kin providing consent for cross-border transport to South Africa. To be transported back to the UK, the body must be embalmed within 3 days of death. The body will then be placed in a hermetically sealed zinc coffin and placed in a packing crate.

Finding an international funeral director A relative or a formally appointed representative must appoint a UK-based international funeral director for the person who died to be repatriated to the UK. The FCDO provides a list of UK-based international funeral directors. Local funeral directors will work with UK-based international funeral directors to meet all the necessary requirements both locally and in the UK. This includes providing documents such as a local civil registry death certificate, a certificate of embalming and a certificate giving permission to transfer the remains to the UK. Advice and financial assistance for repatriation There are UK organisations and charities that may be able to offer assistance with repatriation. Requesting a post-mortem in the UK If you want to have a post-mortem in the UK after the body has been repatriated, you can request one from a UK coroner. The coroner will then decide if a post-mortem is needed.

Jhpiego,2nd October 2020,,https://www.jhpiego.org/story/preventing-maternal-death-worldwide/,"As a young doctor in Kenya, Harshad Sanghvi saw woman after woman arrive at the district hospital bleeding profusely after giving birth at home. Many lived in far-off villages where the local health clinic was little more than a one-room hut. Families would do what they could to get their wives, sisters, daughters to a district or regional hospital in the hopes that a doctor like Sanghvi would save them from bleeding to death. “Several hours of transport and they were dying on our doorsteps,’’ says Sanghvi. That was 20 years ago. Preventing the needless deaths of new mothers and other women became a primary focus of Sanghvi’s research: “The issue was how to take lifesaving, preventive care to all women rather than wait for women to come to hospitals that were so hard to reach.” Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. It occurs when the uterus fails to contract following birth. Pregnant women in Kenya and other developing countries are more vulnerable because they have limited access to skilled health providers and modern health care systems. Sanghvi’s experience as a young doctor in Kenya led him on a path to developing low-cost solutions to health problems of women in some of the most vulnerable corners of the world. For Sanghvi, innovations that save lives of women in developed countries often do not work in low-resource settings because they are too expensive and require facility-based health care systems. He looks for extremely inexpensive interventions that have the chance to reach every woman regardless of where she lives. His work with severe bleeding after birth and misoprostol are one example. “When information first became available about this drug (misoprostol), we immediately saw the potential for tackling the problem of PPH at home birth,” recalls Sanghvi, Vice President and Medical Director of Jhpiego and senior associate at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at John Hopkins University. “The challenge was how to deliver this drug to all women who were pregnant, even those not within the health care system.” The solution for women with little or no access to a trained health care provider took Sanghvi and his research colleagues first to Indonesia and then to rural villages in Faryab, Jawzjan and Kabul provinces in Afghanistan and Banke district in Nepal. The solution lay in training community volunteers to identify all pregnant women, educate these women on the use of misoprostol and then dispense it to them so they could use it immediately following childbirth. Two studies were designed and carried out between June 2005 and August 2007 in the two South Asian countries. Papers co-authored by Sanghvi were released last month in the “International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics.” The studies show that a program to educate rural women on the use of misoprostol after delivering a baby at home can significantly reduce postpartum bleeding and ultimately save lives in the developing world. As Sanghvi puts it, “We have found a good way to get the drug to the woman in the antenatal period; she now has the means to protect herself from PPH even if she cannot reach a skilled professional provider.” As a result, both Afghanistan and Nepal are scaling up the intervention nationally, and an introduction is taking place in at least 12 other countries. More than 50 percent of women in developing countries give birth without a skilled birth attendant at their side. Sixty percent to 80 percent of cases of PPH could be prevented if women had access to appropriate care during labor and birth. Active management of third stage of labor – including the use of a uterontic drug – is the most effective way to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. Misoprostol is one of the most effective of these drugs and easier to use because it can be taken as a pill and administered without a skilled birth attendant. A research trial in India published in 2006 had shown convincingly that misoprostol given by a health care provider at home or in a birthing center reduced postpartum hemorrhage. In addition: Sanghvi and his research partners decided to test a strategy for self-administration of the drug, following education of pregnant women and their families. Community health workers living in some of the most remote areas in Afghanistan identified pregnant women and taught them how to take the medication. They met each pregnant woman and her supporting family members in the months prior to birth, providing one-on-one education on labor and delivery and potential complications of birth, including PPH. Women who agreed to accept misoprostol were visited again at eight months and given the misoprostol – but only after they showed that they understood how and when to use the drug, what minor effects to expect and what to do if PPH occurred even after taking the pills. All took misoprostol correctly – immediately after giving birth and before the placenta was delivered. “In the intervention area where community-based distribution of misoprostol was introduced, near-universal uterotonic coverage (92 percent) was achieved compared with 25 percent coverage in control areas,” the study found. The Afghan study concluded that “community-based education and distribution of misoprostol is safe, acceptable, feasible and effective” – a model for use in other countries where women have limited access to skilled birth attendants. The Nepal study found that distribution of misoprostol by community health volunteers associated with the government health system can reach a high proportion of women in a given area. Among the findings: 18,761 pregnant women were dispensed misoprostol by female community health volunteers with no significant adverse events or misuse or incorrect use; The proportion of deliveries protected by a uterotonic rose from 10.4 percent to 72.5 percent; largest gains were among the poor, illiterate and those living in remote areas; Institutional deliveries increased from 9.9 percent to 16.0 percent; and The maternal mortality ratio among 13,969 misoprostol users was 72/100,000, significantly lower than among non-users (304/100,000), as well as the national level of 281/100,000. “To achieve substantial reductions in maternal risk, there is no substitute for wide use of skilled care at delivery, including a full range of clinical support services and ready access to full emergency obstetric care,” the Nepal study’s authors wrote. “But the excellent need not be the enemy of the good. Substantially increasing skilled care at delivery will be difficult in Nepal and elsewhere. “As we continue efforts to improve coverage and quality of delivery services, interim measures can contribute to driving down the burden of maternal deaths,’’ the authors continued. “This study has demonstrated that high coverage with a preventive dose of uterotonic can be achieved with modest means. Much wider use of misoprostol, focusing on those not yet reachable with more definitive care, targets the principal cause of maternal death in low-resource countries and has the potential to significantly reduce post partum hemorrhage deaths due to atony.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United Nations,12th July 2023,,https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/07/dialogue-lesotho-experts-human-rights-committee-commend-measures-combat-domestic-and,"The Human Rights Committee this morning concluded its consideration of the second periodic report of Lesotho on how it implements the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, with Committee Experts commending measures to combat domestic and gender-based violence, and raising issues concerning the death penalty and attacks on journalists, including the murder of radio journalist Ralikonelo Joki. A Committee Expert noted that commended Lesotho's overall efforts to promote civil and political rights, as presented in the periodic report.  The Committee welcomed protection of women and children from domestic and gender-based violence, and acknowledged measures to combat those practices by certain ministries, non-governmental organisations and especially by the Princess. Another Expert asked whether the State party was intending to keep the present de facto moratorium on the imposition of the death penalty.  Would the State party consider prohibiting mandatory death sentences, and restrict the application of the death penalty to the most serious crimes?  A public referendum on repealing legal provisions related to the death penalty was planned.  Did the State party intend to reconsider the idea of conducting a referendum on such an essential issue? Another Committee Expert said attacks on journalists and the death of Ralikonelo Joki, a radio journalist, in May 2023 were seriously concerning.  What were the circumstances of his death? Presenting the report, Richard Ramoeletsi, Minister of Public Service, Labour and Employment, and head of the delegation, said that the country intended to domesticate all international human rights treaties that it ratified.  Recent non-discrimination legislation included the Harmonization of the Rights of Customary Widows and the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act of 2022 and the Persons with Disabilities Equity Act 2022.  Human rights training had been developed to address the excessive use of force within the Lesotho Defence Force. The country had further made strides in addressing prison overcrowding, political instability and held democratic elections in October 2022.  Mr. Ramoeletsi said challenges such as poverty, food insecurity and HIV/AIDS hampered access to civil and political rights, stressing how support from United Nations agencies and other stakeholders would help to enhance the promotion of those rights. In the ensuing discussion, the delegation said the Government had taken measures to popularise laws on gender-based violence, which would improve reporting of such cases.  Some non-governmental organisations offered victims free legal services.  Training for police addressed gender-based violence.  The Lesotho High Court still imposed death penalty sentences, but if appealed, the Court of Appeal without hesitation commuted such sentences to life imprisonment.  Lesotho would restrict the death penalty to serious crimes.  The referendum on the death penalty was an important bottom-up process.  Four suspects had been arrested in the investigation into the death of the radio journalist in May, the delegation said.  The police statement noted that his death was not related to freedom of expression.  Court proceedings were underway, however had been slowed as one of the accused claimed they were wrongfully accused.  To imagine that the murder was politically motivated was shocking as the journalist was generally well-received.  The police report noting the absence of political motivation was believable, but justice would decide. Tania María Abdo Rocholl, Committee Chairperson, in concluding remarks, thanked the delegation for their cooperation and frank honesty during the dialogue, as well as civil society and members of academia for their contributions.  Issued addressed during the dialogue included domestication of the Covenant, impunity, non-discrimination, reproductive rights, the excessive use of force, the prohibition of torture, child labour, the administration of justice and right to privacy. The delegation of Lesotho was made up of the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Employment, and representatives of the Ministry of Justice; the Human Rights Unit and the Permanent Mission of Lesotho to the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Human Rights Committee’s one hundred and thirty-eighth session is being held from 26 June to 26 July.  All the documents relating to the Committee’s work, including reports submitted by States parties, can be found on the session’s webpage.  Meeting summary releases can be found here.  The webcast of the Committee’s public meetings can be accessed via the UN Web TV webpage. The Committee will next meet in public at 3 p.m., Monday 24 July to hear the presentation of the progress report of the Special Rapporteur on follow-up to concluding observations. Report The Committee has before it the second periodic report of Lesotho (CCPR/C/LSO/2). Presentation of the Report RICHARD RAMOELETSI, Minister of Public Service, Labour and Employment, and head of the delegation, expressed his sincere appreciation to the Committee for the opportunity of presenting the periodic report on measures being taken for the protection of civil and political rights.  He registered the country’s apology for the late submission of the report, after an interval of over twenty years.  Lesotho had had a backlog of State Party reports, and so had made a call to the international community for assistance.  In August 2021, Cabinet had approved the establishment of a National Mechanism on Reporting and Follow-up.  The Government, civil society organisations and other stakeholders participated in the report preparation process.  The Covenant had been translated into the local vernacular for easier dissemination.  A joint work-plan had been devised by all stakeholders. Covenant obligations were realised through the Constitution and Acts of Parliament.  In Lesotho, international law was applicable in the courts of law only when it did not violate the provisions of the Constitution.  Lesotho intended to establish a comprehensive and systematic process for domestication of all international human rights treaties that Lesotho has ratified. The measures put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic were within the parameters provided by the Covenant, and had made progress in curbing the pandemic.  However, the Government admitted that it had missed an opportunity to report to the United Nations Secretary-General that the country had introduced a state of emergency. Commissions of Inquiry were set up to address past human rights violations.  After the 1995 Botha-Buthe killings, such a commission recommended that riot control be part of the curriculum of the Police Training College, and further that a specialised riot control unit be established within the police service and be equipped accordingly.  As a result, a Special Operations Unit was established to deal with similar situations.  In connection with August 2014 events, army officers implicated during an attempted coup and other human rights violations were facing criminal charges and their trial had begun in the High Court. With regards to non-discrimination and equality between men and women, there had been promulgation of laws that prohibited discrimination in various settings with the view to bring equality between men and women.  These laws included Harmonization of the Rights of Customary Widows and the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act of 2022, which granted widows inheritance rights.  Regarding the promotion of civil and political rights of persons with disabilities, Lesotho had enacted Persons with Disabilities Equity Act 2022, prohibiting discrimination of the basis of disability in all areas of life. Lesotho had enacted the Counter Domestic Violence Act 2022, and the Draft Children's Protection and Welfare Bill 2021, which sought to criminalise child marriage, had been finalised and was pending cabinet approval.  Abortion remained illegal per the Penal Code 2010, but could be performed under certain circumstances such as rape. The Lesotho Defence Force was aware of the lack of written guiding tools to address excessive use of force.  Human rights training had been developed in this regard.
In the case of “Mamoleboheng Besel”, four members of the Defence Force had been arrested and charged with murder.  This case was now before the High Court.  Regarding the “Tumelo Mohlomi” murder case, two members of the Lesotho Mounted Police Service were arrested and remanded.  The matter was pending trial while waiting for a ballistics report. The prohibition of torture was guaranteed in the Constitution and the Penal Code listed torture as a crime against humanity.  The Government’s commitment against torture was illustrated by its ratification of the Convention against Torture.  However, there were reports that law enforcement agencies did subject suspects to torture, sometimes leading to death.  Initiatives had been taken to eliminate incidences of torture.  Lesotho was developing a module on police brutality and the use of force for police recruits.  The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act 2011 had been amended in 2021 with a view of redefining the term “trafficking in persons” and to remove an option of a fine for persons convicted of the offence.  With a view to reducing overcrowding, in 2022, 163 inmates were released on Royal Pardon.  Lesotho had made strides to enhance its capacity in relation to the administration of justice.  In May 2022, the High Court received nine newly appointed judges.  The judiciary had been allocated around 6.2 million United States dollars for the financial year of 2023 to 2024 to improve access to justice and the rule of law. To address political instability, since 2014, the Government had engaged in a national dialogue and stability project, with support from the United Nations Development Programme.  The objective of the project was to strengthen the human rights regime.  It resulted in national reforms through the 10th amendment to the Constitution, called the Omnibus Bill, which was yet to be passed by Parliament.  The Bill established a national human rights commission. On 22 June 2023, the Parliament signed a Multi Party Agreement to ensure that every party in Parliament committed to the Omnibus Bill and did not impede the reforms in any manner possible. Lesotho had undergone general elections in October 2022, where democracy, rule of law as well as popular participation had been demonstrated.  The country was beset with challenges, such as high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity and HIV/AIDS, which impeded civil and political rights.  Mr. Ramoeletsi appreciated the technical and financial support that Lesotho was receiving from United Nations agencies, the Commonwealth and individual countries, which were continually offering support to enhance promotion and protection of human rights. Questions by Committee Experts A Committee Expert said the Committee had recommended that the authorities disseminated not only the first national report but also the concluding observations following the consideration of the initial report in 1999, in order to increase public awareness of the provisions of the Covenant and their rights. The Committee had received information that civil society organisations had not been involved in this process and that there had been no measures making the provisions of the Covenant available in local languages.  Was civil society consulted regarding the report?  Had the promotion and dissemination of the Covenant and its Optional Protocol been initiated since the submission of the second national report? Could more information be provided on the mandate of the Police Complaints Investigation Bureau and to what authority it belonged?  To what extent did it interact with judicial authorities?  What specific remedies were available to litigants alleging that their rights had been infringed?  Did the Government have data on the number of complaints brought before the courts, and any follow-up given to them?  Did the State party intend to examine or amend domestic legal provisions that were incompatible with the provisions of the Covenant, including those on customary law?  What was the status of the establishment of the national human rights commission?  Had differences with civil society regarding the appointment process been resolved?  Would resources finally be allocated to the commission? Another Committee Expert asked whether the State party had plans to review and amend section 21(1) of the Constitution permitting derogations from some fundamental rights, to ensure that it was fully consistent with the provisions of the Covenant.  Were emergency measures subject to review by an independent oversight mechanism to ensure that the rights of individuals were not violated? Did the State party intend to review the Internal Security Act giving discretionary powers to the Prime Minister and his cabinet to declare a state of emergency to ensure its compatibility with the provisions of the Covenant? When would the State party adopt a specific anti-torture law that met the requirements of international human rights standards, so that accountability for such acts could be pursued by victims?  How would the State party carry out a thorough, independent and impartial investigation into past and future allegations of torture, and provide appropriate penalties and remedies for victims?  Which perpetrators of torture offences had been prosecuted to date? Had the State party put in place any policies, regulations or guidelines with clear criteria for law enforcement officers on when and how to apply reasonable force?  Did the State party intend to amend section 32 of the Penal Code to be in line with the Covenant?  The Expert asked for statistics on cases of excessive use of force lodged against law enforcement officers.  Did the State party intend to take steps to remove existing provisions allowing corporal punishment?  How was the State party promoting non-lethal crowd control methods?  Had independent mechanisms been established to investigate violations?  What judicial follow-up to investigations had been conducted?  Had perpetrators been identified?  Did victims or their families have access to justice and legal aid?  What measures had been taken to prevent repetition of human rights violations?  Did the Government plan to set up a truth and reconciliation process to identify the root causes of these human rights violations, name the alleged perpetrators and bring them to justice, and support the victims and their families? Women in Lesotho continued to be subjected to multiple forms of discrimination under ordinary and customary laws.  What measures had been taken to ensure equality between men and women since the last review?  Could the State party specify measures aimed at repealing all discriminatory laws against women, especially in the fields of inheritance, access to land, nationality, marriage and its dissolution?  In which cases had the Constitutional Court made decisions on discrimination since the last examination?  The Expert asked for information about laws and measures taken to eliminate discrimination on all grounds. How many staff were serving the victims crime office under the Ministry of Justice and the Lapeng Care Center for victims of sexual and gender based violence?  Were their budgets adequate?  How many cases of human trafficking had been tried in the last five years?  What measures had been taken to protect sex workers and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons against abuse, violence and discrimination, and support their access to health services and to justice?  How many people had been prosecuted or sentenced for the murder of elder women accused of witchcraft in the last five years, and what had been done to prevent such murders from happening? Another Committee Expert commended Lesotho's overall efforts to promote civil and political rights, as presented in the periodic report.  The Committee welcomed protection of women and children from domestic and gender-based violence, and acknowledged measures to combat those practices by certain ministries, non-governmental organisations and especially by the Princess.  Lesotho had enacted the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the Children’s Protection and Welfare Amendment Bill 2019, and after several postponements, the Counter Domestic Violence Bill in 2022.  How would the Counter Domestic Violence Bill be implemented?  Had the State party developed strategies and programmes for tackling patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes against women, and for encouraging women to report domestic and sexual violence?  Did the State party plan to increase the training of the Lesotho Mounted Police Service, as well as other officials and services that were involved with victims of domestic and gender-based violence, especially judges and prosecutors?  Were there plans regarding potential legalisation of abortion?  Had Lesotho developed a strategy to establish control of private clinics where illegal abortions were taking place?  Had Lesotho organised wider awareness campaigns regarding contraception? A Committee Expert asked whether the State party was intending to keep the present de facto moratorium on the imposition of the death penalty.  Would the State party consider prohibiting mandatory death sentences, and restrict the application of the death penalty to the most serious crimes?  A public referendum on repealing legal provisions related to the death penalty was planned.  Did the State party intend to reconsider the idea of conducting a referendum on such an essential issue?  If not, when would the referendum take place?  Would the State party consider ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant, since capital punishment was no longer carried out in practice?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,9th April 2010,,https://www.pih.org/article/expanding-the-role-of-traditional-birth-attendants-in-lesotho,"In the small southern African country of Lesotho, about one out of every four adults is HIV positive, and high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity threaten the country’s young mothers. The rough, mountainous terrain and lack of roads exacerbates the situation, preventing many people from easily accessing the medical services needed to curb the epidemics. To help address these problems, Partners In Health Lesotho (PIHL) is using traditional birth attendants (TBA)—local traditional midwives—to provide women living in rural mountain villages with access to comprehensive services including HIV testing, counselling, and treatment; methods of preventing HIV transmission from mother-to-child; and antenatal (prebirth), delivery, and general post-birth health care; immunizations; as well as general reproductive health services. In May 2009, PIHL, in partnership with the Elton John AIDS Foundation, began to pilot a TBA program in a catchment area that includes 71 villages around PIHL’s health center in Bobete. PIHL hired and trained 100 local women to serve as a link between the clinic and pregnant women—who are literally their neighbors. The TBAs locate and accompany the expectant mothers through their pregnancy and birth to ensure that they have full access to the clinic’s comprehensive services. This includes bringing the women to the clinic to deliver their babies. The TBAs are a part of Lesotho’s traditional midwifery community and PIHL seeks not to replace them, but to further their education and employ them in an expanded role as community health workers in the communities of which they are already a part. And as families traditionally pay TBAs for delivering babies, the PIHL program provides a cash incentive for each woman a TBA accompanies, replacing the income lost when women choose to deliver at the health center. ccomplishments of the Lesotho TBA project during its first seven months: 399 antenatal visits at the Bobete clinic. 250 pregnant women counselled by TBAs. 172 (69%) of the women counselled by TBAs attend at least one antenatal visit. All 172 women weretested for HIV—15 tested positive for HIV.Had 64 mothers give birth at the Bobete clinic. Of these, 53 (83%) were accompanied by TBAs. Surveyed 7,655 women of childbearing age to establish baseline data for monitoring and evaluating the project. In the first six months of the project, the TBAs completed their training, surveyed their villages, and began to visit pregnant women in their homes. They accompanied 172 women to the clinic for antenatal care, and accompanied 53 women to deliver at the clinic. Clinic deliveries have steadily risen in response to TBA outreach, with at least 24 women giving birth at the health center last month. The advantages of delivering in the Bobete clinic are significant, particularly in preventing the transmission of HIV during childbirth. Delivering with the assistance of a skilled nurse decreases the risks of maternal mortality and morbidity, and infants with health issues can receive immediate medical attention.
To enable more women to deliver at the health center, PIHL is renting waiting houses near the clinic that can shelter six women at a time. Rough terrain separating the remote villages from the health center can make the journey virtually impossible for a woman with labor complications, so these houses make it possible for women to make the journey before labor begins. As an extra incentive, PIHL also provides new mothers who fulfil certain criteria (get tested for HIV, attend at least three antenatal visits and deliver their baby at the clinic) with a new baby package, which includes clothing (hat and sweater), pins, and a bathtub. During the programs first six months, PIHL distributed 60 new baby packages. PIHL believes that the accompaniment of the TBAs and the general knowledge and care delivered during the antenatal visits will encourage each woman to deliver her baby at the clinic, and that in doing so families in the Bobete catchment area will see a decrease in HIV mother-to-child transmission rates, as well as maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates. In the coming year, the PIHL team hopes to expand this program to six more rural health centers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Soderton university,2021,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1586458/FULLTEXT01.pdf,"Child mortality rates do not only reflect the development in a society but also reflect access to basic health interventions and socio-economic conditions. The uneven distribution of child mortality rates is a matter of inequity. Even though there has been a reduction in the child mortality  indicator neonatal mortality rate on the global level, the rate is still unacceptably high. Data indicates that it in a few countries, such as Lesotho, the neonatal mortality has an arrested decrease even though being a focus area within the sustainable development goals. This explorative case study aims at finding and explaining the factors behind the arrested decrease in neonatal mortality
in Lesotho. Framing this study are the social determinants of health. The results indicate that the combination of HIV and droughts with exacerbated poverty and increased requirements for adequate care as a result, in combination with the vulnerable situation of women has aggravated the situation for new-borns in Lesotho. In order to improve the survival of new-borns in Lesotho measures cannot solely be aimed at improving health care but also have to be directed beyond the direct cause of death such as measures to improve the factors causing poor health. In order to achieve better prerequisites for new-borns measures have to overcome health inequity. It is a
fundamental human rights concern. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recognizes the right to life as “the supreme right” and states that this right should be interpreted widely and include positive measures, such as those related to reducing child mortality rates (Kaltenborn,
2020; OHCHR, 2009). Despite this, children worldwide are dying as a result of poor governance, unequally distributed resources and hampered development (Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), 2008). In 2000 the world leaders agreed on a total of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG) that aimed at fighting extreme poverty. Of these, MDG number four aimed at reducing child mortality (United Nations (UN), 2015). However, when the goals were assessed in 2015, the vast majority of targets that were quantifiably measurable were not achieved (Ritchie, H. & Roser, M., 2018). One of the goals that was not achieved was goal number four, target a): “To reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate” (UN, 2015). Therefore, when the world community decided on “the new era” of goals, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), “to complete what they [the MDGs] did not achieve” (p.5), the goal to reduce child mortality was still included. It reads “Goal 3.2, By 2030, end preventable deaths of new-borns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births” (UN General Assembly, 2015, p.20). UN Development Programme (UNDP) (2005) states that “no indicator captures the divergence in human development opportunity more powerfully than child mortality” (p.4). The infant mortality rate, of which neonatal mortality is a part, is the most unequally distributed health indicator, both between and within countries (CSDH, 2008). The circumstances into which a child is born affects their health and their ability to survive. (CSDH, 2008; Solar & Irwin, 2010). The survival of a child does not solely depend on adequate and accessible healthcare but is also largely dependent on the socio-economic conditions surrounding the child and its keypersons (Mugo, Agho, Zwi, Damundu & Dibley, 2018). Even though the death of a child can be prescribed a medical condition the explanation is rarely solely medical, but can often be linked to insufficient socio-economic conditions, especially in poor countries. Therefore, it is of great importance to look beyond the official cause of death when discussing child mortality, taking into account how the child may be subject to health inequities (CSDH, 2008; UNICEF, 2015). The Social Determinants of Health (SDH) is a basic and conventional global health concept that seeks to explain and understand the factors and processes behind health outcomes and development. The unequal distribution of poor health and health hazards is referred to as ‘health inequity’ and is a prominent concern within the SDH. Human rights, justice and good governance are fundamental parts in actions on the SDH (CSDH, 2008).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BMC pregnancy and Chiuld Care,23rd December 2019,,https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2673-0,"Intrapartum fetal mortality can be prevented by quality emergency obstetrics and newborn care (EmONC) during pregnancy and childbirth. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a low-dose high-frequency onsite clinical mentorship in EmONC on the overall reduction in intrapartum fetal deaths in a busy hospital providing midwife-led maternity services in rural Kenya. Methods A quasi-experimental (nonequivalent control group pretest – posttest) design in a midwife-led maternity care hospitals. Clinical mentorship and structured supportive supervision on EmONC signal functions was conducted during intervention. Maternity data at two similar time points: Oct 2015 to July 2016 (pre) and August 2016 to May 2017 (post) reviewed. Indicators of interest at Kirkpatrick’s levels 3 and 4 focusing on change in practice and health outcomes between the two time periods were evaluated and compared through a two-sample test of proportions. Proportions and p-values were reported to test the strength of the evidence after the intervention. Results Spontaneous vaginal delivery was the commonest route of delivery between the two periods in both hospitals. At the intervention hospital, assisted vaginal deliveries (vacuum extractions) increased 13 times (0.2 to 2.5%, P < 0.0001), proportion of babies born with low APGAR scores requiring newborn resuscitation doubled (1.7 to 3.7%, P = 0.0021), proportion of fresh stillbirths decreased 5 times (0.5 to 0.1%, P = 0.0491) and referred cases for comprehensive emergency obstetric care doubled (3.0 to 6.5%, P < 0.0001) with no changes observed in the control hospital. The proportion of live births reduced (98 to 97%, P = 0.0547) at the control hospital. Proportion of macerated stillbirths tripled at the control hospital (0.4 to 1.4%, P = 0.0039) with no change at the intervention hospital. Conclusion Targeted mentorship improves the competencies of nurse/midwives to identify, manage and/or refer pregnancy and childbirth cases and/or complications contributing to a reduction in intrapartum fetal deaths. Scale up of this training approach will improve maternal and newborn health outcomes. Peer Review reports Introduction Approximately three – quarters of all neonatal deaths occur during the first week of life, with a million babies dying on the day they are born [1]. Annually 2.6 million stillbirths occur worldwide with 98% of them occurring in developing countries [2, 3]. Intrapartum-related events are now the third leading cause of all deaths among children under age 5 years with nearly half of newborn deaths taking place during the first day of life [4]. The low proportion of intrapartum stillbirths in high-income countries suggests that intrapartum stillbirths are largely preventable with quality intrapartum care including prompt recognition and management of intrapartum complications [5]. Most maternal and newborn deaths are in principle preventable [6]. Progress has been made in the reduction of newborn mortality rates by 47% worldwide between 1990 and 2015, from 36 to 19 deaths per 1000 live births. However, the rate has declined more slowly in most low-resource settings, and is still far from the Sustainable Development Goal target of less than 12 newborn deaths per 1000 live births by 2030 [7, 8]. In 2014, the Every Newborn Action Plan, a global multi-partner movement to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths, set a target for national stillbirth rates of 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 births in all countries by 2030, accompanied by action in countries to address disparities [6]. Access to and utilization of high quality, evidence-based intrapartum care is one way to further reduce intrapartum death rates [5, 9, 10]. It is widely accepted that the intrapartum stillbirth rates of a hospital or country is reflective of the quality of care received during labor, and newborn mortality in the 24 h following birth can reflect the quality of care during labor as well as immediate postnatal care. Quality of maternity care is often limited by gaps in individual clinicians, nurses/midwives’ knowledge and skills, as well as systems level issues, such as supply and human resource management – staff shortage and maldistribution of health personnel [11,12,13]. A number of surveys in developing countries have shown that the majority of healthcare facilities in low and middle income settings, although designated to provide either basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC), may be unable to do so [14,15,16]. In many cases, structures are in place, and equipment and consumables are reported to be available, but the staffs reported that they lacked competency and skills and were therefore unable to provide all the signal functions of EmONC and essential newborn care [14, 16, 17]. In other instances, the lack of knowledge and skills to provide EmONC is compounded by non-utilization of simple but proven health technologies and equipment [18, 19]. Skills competency-based training in skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric and early newborn care is an approach that is successful in improving knowledge and skills [20]. Skilled health personnel trained to International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) standards can provide nearly all of the essential care needed for women and newborns. This includes performing all signal functions of emergency maternal and newborn care to optimize the health and well-being of women and newborns [21]. Insufficient pre-service and in-service training is a key barrier to provision of quality EmONC services [22,23,24]. This therefore calls for the need to build the capacity of healthcare providers to recognize and manage complications during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. In-service training for skilled birth attendants is one of the most common interventions to address lack of knowledge and skills and improve health outcomes [20, 25]. Targeted, repeated training and/or mentorship approaches at the job site are preferable to one-time training and lead to the use of new skills in the clinical setting. Evidence suggests that these approaches are associated with greater improvement in clinical performance, knowledge and skills retention and health outcomes [11, 20, 26,27,28,29]. However, there is little evidence generated on the utilization and applicability of these mentorship and on-the-job training methods, which can be instrumental in maintaining the skills and competence in areas trained in Kenya [13]. Kenya’s perinatal mortality, defined as the pregnancy losses occurring after seven completed months of gestation (stillbirths) plus deaths to live births within the first 7 days of life (early neonatal deaths) is 29 per 1000 live births [30]. Two major causes of newborn deaths in Kenya, birth asphyxia and sepsis could be prevented by increasing the use of evidence-based interventions during labor, birth and the immediate postnatal period [31]. The Kenya Health Policy 2012–2030 and the Kenya health sector strategic and investment plan 2012–2017 describe the country’s goal to reduce institutional newborn mortality from 31 to 13 per 1000 live births by 2030 through training of skilled birth attendants in basic emergency obstetrics and newborn care and essential newborn care [32, 33]. Busia County Government’s Department of Health implemented a low-dose high-frequency (LDHF) facility-level focused mentorship program with support from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfID) Boresha project implemented by Save the Children International in the main referral facilities for staffs in maternity and mother & child health (MCH) departments targeting to reduce maternal and neonatal mortalities. Using this approach for in-service training, healthcare workers were mentored on key evidence-based intrapartum and immediate newborn care practices, using current national/global guidelines on job site. The indicators of change in practice and health outcomes after mentorship in a busy basic emergency obstetrics and newborn care (BEmONC) facility providing midwife-led maternity services were evaluated using the adapted Kirkpatrick framework for evaluating a training program. This framework has four distinct levels of training evaluation: level 1 (reaction – acceptance to mentorship), level 2 (learning – change in knowledge and skills), level 3 (behavior – change in behavior and practice) and level 4 (results – health outcomes and change in perinatal mortalities) [34, 35]. Evaluation of the effectiveness of LDHF mentorship targeted the Kirkpatrick’s levels 3 and 4 focusing on the change in practice and health outcomes. Multiple training/mentorship interventions implemented by several partners in the same group of healthcare providers have focused on evaluating levels 1 and 2 [20]. This study hypothesized that the LDHF mentorship approach to improving clinical skills would lead to an increase in assisted vaginal deliveries and overall reduction in institutional intrapartum stillbirths and early neonatal mortality in a busy rural BEmONC facility in Busia County. Methods Design and setting This was a nonequivalent control group pretest – posttest design, a quasi-experimental design that involves an experimental treatment and two groups (study and control) of subjects, not randomly assigned, observed before and after its implementation [36]. The experimental treatment was the low-dose high-frequency mentorship while the two groups were a study hospital where mentorship implemented by the project was provided and a control hospital where no intervention was provided. Both hospitals were reviewed before as well as during the mentorship, to test if the LDHF mentorship made any difference in the practice and perinatal outcomes. Data was reviewed at two similar period points. The pre-intervention period reviewed was Oct 2015 to July 2016 while the post-intervention period was August 2016 to May 2017 (last 10 months of the intervention before the protracted nurses strike that paralyzed operations in all government facilities for 6 months from June 2017) in a high-volume referral hospital. The mentorship program started in August 2016 and ended in May 2017 in the county and at the study hospital. The hospitals were optimally functioning during the periods reviewed in this study. The mentorship focused on the mode of delivery, newborn resuscitation and referral for delivery services as the indicators of change in practice and change in health outcomes after training/mentorship as study designs involving direct observation of practice may be expensive and underpowered [20]. These are routine indicators captured and reported by the healthcare workers in the national MOH registers. The study hospital was Nambale subcounty hospital from Nambale subcounty while the control hospital was Khunyangu subcounty hospital from Butula subcounty, two subcounties out of the seven that make up Busia county in Western Kenya region. This region had a high perinatal mortality rate (26 per 1000 live births vs the country’s average of 29 as per the 2014 KDHS report). The control hospital was from one of the three subcounties that were not part of the maternal and newborn health project implementation by Save the Children in Busia county. The two hospitals had similar characteristics (level, staffing, infrastructure and health services) as they were all level 3 health facilities and provided midwifery-led maternity services [32, 33]. The study and control hospitals are the largest BEmONC referral facilities in their respective subcounties and operate as level 3 facilities providing basic emergency obstetrics and newborn care. The study and control hospitals recorded an average of 1100 and 1400 deliveries respectively per annum as at 2017. These were ideal sites to assess the difference or effectiveness of a LDHF mentorship approach as they provided 24-h coverage per day and recorded the highest deliveries compared to other facilities in the same level in the county. Secondly, the maternity services at these facilities are midwife-led and the facilities offer other integrated comprehensive reproductive health services including cervical cancer screening, prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV/AIDs (PMTCT) and laboratory services. In addition, these facilities are training/learning centres for trainee nurses as well as clinical offers in the region. Importantly, the hospitals offer both promotive and preventive care as well as curative care with majority of the population selecting them as their primary health facilities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Guttmacher Institute,June 2004,,https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/ipsrh/2004/06/provision-family-planning-services-lesotho,"For a long time, little was known about fertility in Lesotho. The 1977 Lesotho Fertility Survey reported that the total fertility rate averaged five births per woman, a moderate level by Sub-Saharan African standards. Because only 7% of married women of reproductive age were using contraceptives in 1977, this moderate fertility level may have resulted from long periods of postpartum abstinence due to male labor migration to South African mines.1 The last three national censuses (conducted in 1976, 1986 and 1996) have documented a decline in the total fertility rate from 5.6 to 4.1 births per woman.2 Nevertheless, the government considers fertility too high. To prevent adverse consequences of rapid population growth, such as a high unemployment rate, poor economic performance, a high demand for social services and a decrease in resources, the government adopted a population policy in 1994 whose aim is to achieve replacement-level fertility (a total fertility rate of about 2.2 children per woman) by 2011.3 A major strategy of the population policy has been to expand the family planning program so that contraceptive prevalence increases to 70-75% by 2011. Specifically, the policy aims to provide a wide range of family planning methods as an integral part of health care at all service levels; to equip hospitals and clinics to provide IUDs, sterilization and injectable contraceptives; and to provide adequate information, education and communication. An initial goal was to raise contraceptive prevalence to 31% by 1996. In 1998, prevalence was estimated to be only 23%,4 but it increased to 41% in 2001.5 The 1994 population policy had several limitations. For example, its demographic targets were not all based on research and were overly optimistic, and maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS were not given adequate consideration. In addition, because the policy predated the 1994 United Nations-sponsored International Conference on Population and Development, it did not reflect the conclusions and recommendations contained in the conference's Programme of Action (for example, on issues of reproductive health and rights, adolescents' and young people's health concerns, gender equality, equity and empowerment of women).6 As a result, a revised version of the policy has been under review for several years. Although critics have questioned the magnitude of family planning programs' impact on fertility reduction, programs unquestionably still have a vital role to play in the demographic transition of Sub-Saharan African countries.7 As young people enter the reproductive years, the demand for family planning services will increase, and programs need to be equipped to satisfy this demand. Thus, studying family planning outlets' readiness to provide contraception is one way of assessing whether a country is likely to achieve its reproductive health goals.8 In the early 1980s, Mauldin and Ross rated Lesotho's family planning program as ""weak,"" whereas they rated programs in neighboring countries as ""moderately strong"" (South Africa and Zimbabwe) or ""strong"" (Botswana).9 Lesotho's family planning program has improved since then,10 but further improvements are required. In this article, we describe current practices in family planning service provision in Lesotho, and make suggestions for improving contraceptive prevalence. BACKGROUND Lesotho is an independent kingdom in southern Africa, bordered completely by the Republic of South Africa. The country is divided into four ecological zones: the mountain region, the lowlands, the Senqu River Valley and the foothills. The mountain region comprises 59% of the land area and is home to 23% of the population. The major urban areas are in the lowlands, which account for 59% of the population. Lesotho's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and exportation of labor. In 2001, the unemployment rate was 43%. A large proportion of men (26% of those aged 30-39 and 31% of those aged 40-49) migrated to South Africa for temporary employment in the mines, leaving their families in Lesotho.11 This pattern of migration may help explain some unusual features of the Basotho society12 —for example, in 2001, 52% of females 15 and older were literate (i.e., had completed primary school), compared with 37% of males.13 From the time of independence in 1966, the government of Lesotho recognized the constraints that rapid population growth was placing on economic development. However, fearing a negative response from the generally pronatalist society, it was initially cautious about offering modern family planning methods as part of its health promotion activities, although it encouraged private-sector activities.14 In 1968, the government approved the formation of the Lesotho Family Planning Association, now known as the Lesotho Planned Parenthood Association (LPPA). The government became directly involved in family planning activities in the late 1970s, when it adopted primary health care as the cornerstone of its health delivery system. This led to the establishment of 182 registered health facilities—21 hospitals and 161 freestanding clinics.15 These hospitals offer integrated health care, including family planning consultation, treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), immunizations, maternal and child health care, and curative services. In addition, all government health facilities offer family planning consultation, immunization, maternal and child health care, and basic curative services. Currently, 148 registered health facilities remain in operation; 87 of them offer modern family planning services. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) has the overall responsibility for managing the national family planning program. This ministry and LPPA are the main providers of family planning services; other providers are the Christian Health Association of Lesotho, the Red Cross and private practitioners. Funding for family planning comes from various donors, including the United Nations Population Fund and the United States Agency for International Development. The government allocates 5% of its budget to MOHSW, and 40% of this allocation goes to the Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning Department.16 LPPA is supported mainly by the International Planned Parenthood Federation; some funds come from revenue generated from its operations and from fund-raising activities. Since 1988, the government has required all facilities that offer family planning services (except small surgical facilities and clinics run by private practitioners) to charge uniform, subsidized prices for family planning commodities. To compensate for the loss of revenue resulting from the uniform pricing policy, LPPA receives a grant from the government. The Christian Health Association owns about 40% of all health facilities in Lesotho.17 The government pays the salaries of all health-related personnel in these facilities, but member churches have a major say in the facilities' administration. For example, sites operated by the Roman Catholic church, which constitute about half of the association's facilities, do not provide artificial methods of contraception, although individual staff sometimes do. Lesotho does not have an explicit family planning policy. Service providers have few guidelines to follow and often make their own rules because of ambiguities. For example, parity-related restrictions exist for surgical contraceptive methods, but the number of children that a client must have is vague.18 Some providers require the consent of the partner, and others do not. Surgical methods can be provided only at hospitals, while injectables and IUDs can be provided at family planning clinics or hospitals. Advertising of contraceptives is not restricted. The methods available in Lesotho are vasectomy, female sterilization, combined and progestin-only pills, inject- ables, IUDs, spermicides, diaphragms, cervical caps, condoms and, to a lesser extent, female condoms and implants. Official statistics are thought to underestimate contraceptive prevalence, because about 20% of health facilities do not send records to the Health Statistics Unit. Nevertheless, available data indicate that prevalence increased moderately between 1990 and 1996 (Figure 1). The pill was the most commonly used method through 1994, after which it was overtaken by the injectable. Use of condoms, the third most prevalent method, has generally increased throughout the years, except for an unexplained drop in 1995. The prevalence of condom use would be higher if sales from outlets such as supermarkets, pharmacies and private physicians were included. Use of natural family planning and other methods is negligible. Prevalence of IUD use has been almost constant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VSO International ,,,https://www.vsointernational.org/our-work/volunteering-for-development/improving-srh-services-for-young-people-in-lesotho,"In Lesotho’s Mafeteng district, we've partnered with the Ministry of Health to improve access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services for some of the area's most marginalised young people. The project has established 17 dedicated young people’s spaces within the district’s health facilities, and trained 680 peer educators (40 in each facility), who work to share health information with young people. Engaging the region’s most hard-to-reach young men Among these peer educators are herd boys – one of the community’s most marginalised groups – who previously had little access to health information.  Through the peer to peer approach, 40 educators have been able to engage with over 200 further herd boys. Bringing together young people from across Lesotho The local informal spaces and platforms are linked to the national Lesotho Youth Consortium, which brings together 30 different youth organisations – representing over 100 young people – from across the country, from both rural and urban areas. Young people meet every two weeks to discuss SRH issues and learn from peer educators. Young people living with disabilities come together in a specific network, which supports them to access services equitably, and works to ensure their rights are respected.  Taking the Government to task over youth-focused health services A key strand of the Consortium’s work is advocating for change, and holding the Government accountable on issues of young people’s access to SRH services. As part of this work, we’ve been supporting a citizen-led monitoring approach, where adolescents use scorecards to rate the health services available to them. This project shows young people they have a right to assess health services, and call the government out when they aren’t up to standard.

United Nations Population Fund ,12th March 2020,Mokhotlong District,https://www.unfpa.org/news/climate-change-affected-lesotho-self-injected-contraceptives-empower-women-choose-their-own,"HA MOEKETSANE, Lesotho – Regina Mokoena has seen first-hand how drought and climate change are increasing the demand for family planning in her village. Ms. Mokoena is a local health worker in Ha Moeketsane, in Lesotho’s mountainous rural Mokhotlong District. She says drought is disrupting livelihoods in this farming community, making it harder for parents to support large families. “In these difficult times, it is not easy to look for a job or to get employed when you have many children, especially here in the village,” she said. “Besides, educating children is also very demanding.” During last summer’s cropping season, the district of Mokhotlong was one of the hardest hit by severe drought. Large numbers of livestock – a main source of livelihood – were lost. Village health worker Regina Mokoena is helping to inform women in communities that they can now use a self-administered family planning method in the comfort of their homes. © UNFPA Lesotho/Violet Maraisane Ms. Mokoena says the economic uncertainty has fuelled demand for contraceptives among the district’s women, including interest in a new form of family planning uniquely well suited to rural areas without easy access to health services: injectable contraceptives that women can administer themselves. Unmet need for family planning Mokhotlong has one of Lesotho’s highest rates of unmet need for family planning. This has led to the highest fertility rate in the country, with each woman having an average of 4.4 children. The gap between actual fertility and a woman’s desired fertility is also the largest, according to a recent household survey. In addition, the district’s teen pregnancy rate is the nation’s second highest, with 24 per cent of girls aged 15-19 having begun childbearing. But these are not just issues in Mokhotlong. Across the country, unsafe abortion is a primary reason for the hospitalization of women and girls, a 2019 Annual Joint Review found. UNFPA is working with the government to expand access to family planning to all women who want it. Voluntary family planning reduces unintended pregnancies, adolescent pregnancies, maternal death and recourse to abortion. The introduction of the self-administered injectable contraceptive is helping to advance this effort by increasing the options available to women. UNFPA and the Ministry of Health have been training health workers like Ms. Mokoena to teach women to inject the contraceptive themselves. Ms. Mokoena says she has been speaking to public gatherings about it, and the response has been largely positive. Nurse-in-Charge, ‘Manthati Sekoati, points to the self-injected contraceptive on a chart of family planning options available to women in the area. © UNFPA Lesotho/Violet Maraisane A new option for privacy and convenience The self-injected contraceptive is relatively new in the mix of family planning options, but it has already proved popular. Last year, UNFPA procured 13 million units of the contraceptive, and demand continues to outstrip availability. Globally, nearly 40,000 midwives and 48,000 community health workers have been trained by UNFPA to provide this form of family planning. Still, for many women, the thought of administering their own injections is daunting – something to be weighed against the product’s advantages. “I like the new contraceptive as it will help me space my children,” said Thato,* who lives in Mokhotlong. “I am currently afraid to inject myself though. But I guess I will have to overcome my fear to avoid regularly walking for close to an hour to get to the clinic.” The self-injected contraceptive can also reduce stigma, said ‘Manthati Sekoati, the nurse-in-charge at Mapholaneng Clinic in Mokhotlong. Young people are often embarrassed to be seen accessing reproductive health care, she noted, and women face social pressures to have large families. If they can administer their own contraceptives at home, they are more likely to be empowered to choose the size and spacing of their families. Still, do have to make at least one visit to the clinic, Ms. Sekoati said. They have to come to learn how to administer the injection themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
National Liberty of Medicine,2021,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205055/,"Background: Rates of adolescent HIV and unintended pregnancy in southern Africa are amongst the highest in the world. Gender-transformative interventions that address underlying gender inequalities and engage both males and females have been emphasised by the World Health Organisation, amongst others, to target prevention. However, few such gender-transformative interventions have been rigorously developed or evaluated. Objective: To expedite potential impact and reduce development costs, we conducted a needs assessment to inform the co-design, in consultation with local stakeholders, of adapted versions of an existing gender-transformative Relationships and Sexuality Education intervention for use in South Africa and Lesotho. Methods: Adaptation of the intervention was guided by a modified version of Intervention Mapping (IM). This process involved consultation with separate adolescent, community and expert advisory groups and a collaboratively conducted needs assessment, which drew on focus groups with adolescents (8 groups, n = 55) and adults (4 groups, n = 22) in South Africa and Lesotho, and was informed by our systematic review of the literature on the determinants of condom use among adolescents in the region. Results: The findings clarified how the intervention should be adapted, which individual- and environmental-level determinants of condom use to target, and actions for facilitating successful adoption, evaluation and implementation in the new settings. Conclusions: The IM approach allows for a systematic appraisal of whether components and processes of an existing intervention are appropriate for a new target population before costly evaluation studies are conducted. The findings will be of interest to those wishing to rigourously develop and evaluate gender-transformative interventions engaging men to improve health for all. KEYWORDS: Sexual and reproductive health, adaptation, intervention mapping, adolescent boys, gender transformative Go to: Background Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Southern Africa Unintended pregnancy and HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are major global adolescent health challenges. In 2019, around 170,000 adolescents aged 10–19 years around the world were newly infected with HIV and concerns are that, if current trends continue, hundreds of thousands more will be become HIV-positive in the coming years [1]. Although HIV/AIDS has long been the primary sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issue on the national agenda for South Africa [2], HIV rates are still high: 18% among 15–49 year olds and 6% among adolescents [3]. Further, adolescents consistently present with poorer adherence to treatment and clinical outcomes (i.e. hospitalisation and mortality rates) than adults [4]. Lesotho has the second-highest HIV prevalence in the world, estimated in 2019 at 23% among 15–49 year olds and 10% and 5% among 15–24 year old women and men respectively [5]. Additionally, nearly half (48%) of sexually active adolescents in Lesotho report that they do not regularly use condoms [3]. Adolescent pregnancy is also a pressing health and social issue. Pregnancy is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity for adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to issues including delivery complications and unsafe abortions [6]. It is a significant contributor to gender inequality in education, often resulting in interruption or termination of girls’ schooling, and thus a major impediment to social and economic development [7]. Twenty-seven percent of women in South Africa [8] and 19% in Lesotho [3] are pregnant by the time they are 19 years old. Over half of the 260,000 abortions that take place every year in South Africa are unsafe (i.e. performed by persons lacking necessary skills and/or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards), even though abortion is legal [9]. In Lesotho, abortion is criminalised and unsafe terminations account for up to 50% of inpatient deaths among females aged 13 years and older in some Lesotho hospitals [10]. Gender transformative interventions for young adolescent boys The continued existence of high rates of pregnancy and HIV in African adolescents after 30 years of focused attention suggests that there are deeply rooted cultural and socio-economic factors that foster high-risk sexual behaviours. It is now recognised that a key determinant of these global health challenges is gender inequalities plus restrictive masculinities and associated practices that predispose adolescent men and women to the risk of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy (e.g. unprotected/condomless sex, multiple and concurrent sexual partnerships, sex while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, and gender-power relations linked to sexual violence) [11]. International health and development frameworks therefore emphasise the importance of working with both boys and girls in order to reduce gender inequality and improve SRH outcomes for all [12,13]. Gender Transformative (GT) approaches seek to examine and change harmful gender and power imbalances and encourage men’s role as enablers rather than inhibiters of women’s health and well-being [14–16]. Typically, GT interventions in adolescent SRH seek to address restrictive masculinity norms relating to heterosexual prowess and gendered power relations (e.g. promoting shared sexual decision-making between males and females) and challenge negative gender socialisation (e.g. challenge perceptions that ‘real men’ don’t wear condoms or that girls should not carry condoms) [17,18]. In line with ‘social norms’ approaches, GT interventions generally attempt to harness the misalignment between people’s individual behaviours and attitudes and existing social norms in order to affect change [19]. Strategies often also include changing gender norm attitudes among an influential social group and leveraging their influence as agents of change in their peer groups and communities [20]. Although GT approaches have been applauded for their focus on gender inequalities, evaluations of GT programmes have also been criticised for their lack of methodological scope and rigour [18,21]. Scholars are also beginning to understand that, in order to be truly transformative, GT programmes must also seek to address the intersectional influences of other social factors on gender inequalities including race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and poverty [14,16,18,22]. While GT interventions recognise that men have a vital yet neglected role in reducing unintended adolescent pregnancy and HIV rates, there is a global dearth of robustly evaluated GT programmes targeting adolescent boys to prevent HIV and early unintended pregnancy. This gap in programming has been noted as a primary objective by a group of global leaders known as the Bellagio Working Group on Gender and Growth [23] as a means of reducing gender inequality by 2030 [24]. Further, a 2019 WHO systematic review of reviews on research engaging men and boys in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) indicated that only 8% of the included reviews (39/462 reviews) reported studies using a GT approach with men and boys, and only 10% of these (4 reviews) focused on adolescent SRH [16]. A second WHO systematic review which examined the components and characteristics of GT interventions involving men and boys determined that only 24% (16/68) of experimental studies used a GT approach with adolescents [25]. Only five of those 16 studies specifically engaged male adolescents in promoting sexual health and well-being (including HIV and STI prevention), desired family size or ensuring the health of pregnant women and girls. Furthermore, only two of those five studies were located in sub-Saharan Africa (1 in South Africa and 1 in Ethiopia). The South African study was a quasi-experimental study that focused on STI/HIV prevention only (not unintended pregnancy). This body of work suggests that the evaluation and implementation of GT interventions in southern Africa is absent and firmly supports the urgent need for conducting and disseminating information about robust evaluation programmes. The value of intervention adaptation
In the field of adolescent SRH, scaling-up programmes that have demonstrated impact in a specific context has been recommended by Douglas Kirby as ‘the single most promising strategy for reducing teen pregnancy and STI/HIV’ [26] (p.187). A major challenge with this approach, however, is that the effectiveness of public health interventions is usually linked to the social and cultural context in which they are implemented; thus, interventions that show impact in one context may not necessarily be effective in a new setting or with a new population [27]. Increasingly, therefore, public health researchers are systematically identifying and modifying key intervention components and implementation processes to fit new contexts [28]. This approach may be particularly valuable in LMICs, where resources are limited for developing and evaluating new interventions and where there is a greater reliance on evidence from other settings regarding interventions that show promise in the original context. A recent systematic review of adaptation processes recommends the use of rigourous adaptation frameworks when scaling-up programmes to new settings, although such frameworks are currently used in less than one-third of intervention adaptation studies [28]. Our study aimed to address these gaps in the literature by working with local stakeholders in Lesotho and South Africa (where rates of HIV/AIDS and unintended adolescent pregnancy are among the highest in the world) to co-design contextually relevant adaptations of a SRH intervention guided by a systematic adaptation framework. The gender-transformative If I Were Jack (JACK) intervention [29–31], developed for use in the UK, targets adolescent men through a variety of individual, school- and home-based material designed to help adolescents reduce sexual risk-taking (unprotected/condomless sex) and address gender inequalities in SRH. We used a systematic and participatory process, working closely with local stakeholders, to initiate what we believe is the first robust study of a GT adolescent pregnancy- and HIV-focused intervention specifically targeting adolescent men in South Africa and Lesotho, but also applicable and designed to be delivered to adolescent women alongside adolescent men. This paper details the development phase of a planned larger study which will optimise and test the contextually-adapted versions of JACK in a feasibility randomised trial. Aims & objectives The aim of the study is to use a systematic and collaborative process to design sociocultural adaptations of the If I Were Jack intervention for use in Khayelitsha, South Africa and Maseru, Lesotho. Study Objectives (repeated in both countries): Convene Project Advisory Groups: Separate adolescent and community groups were convened in each country. Groups were consulted twice during the project to decide how best to: a) engage with the broader community for a successful project; b) address culturally-sensitive issues; and c) adapt, as needed, the JACK educational pedagogies for local contexts. Conduct Needs Assessment: We conducted an assessment of target population sexual and reproductive health needs and clarified contextually relevant determinants of condom use. This was based on a new systematic literature review and primary qualitative research (focus groups) with local adults and adolescents. Conduct Intervention Mapping Exercise: Based on findings from the needs assessment (systematic review and focus groups) and in consultation with advisory groups, we conducted an intervention mapping exercise. This aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the JACK components for use in these new settings and produce detailed plans for adaptation, implementation and evaluation of the original JACK into new culturally bespoke interventions. These plans formed the basis of proposals for further research funding to develop and evaluate the interventions. Go to: Methods Study design The research design was grounded in three methodological approaches: The UK MRC (2008) Framework for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions to guide the overall research design [32]. This framework helped ensure that this formative work was conceptualised as an MRC ‘Phase 1ʹ development study that would lead to either further development work and feasibility testing at the next stages; Intervention Mapping [33] involving evidence synthesis and primary research with local stakeholders to guide the adaptation process. This framework was chosen because it offered guidelines for a systematic process for cultural adaptation; and
A participatory approach to research involving consultation with local stakeholders including adolescents, parents, teachers, and community-based service providers as a means of including their unique experiences and needs in relation to matters that affect them [34]. Ensuring methodological rigour was a primary concern and we were guided in this endeavour by Lincoln and Guba’s concept of trustworthiness, incorporating considerations of credibility, dependability, confirmability and transferability [35]. Our approach to incorporating each of these considerations is addressed the relevant sections below. Original intervention If I Were Jack [70,83,84] is an evidence-informed, theory-based, gender-transformative (challenges gender inequalities relating to SRH) RSE programme designed to reduce unintended teenage pregnancy and promote positive sexual health. It aims to increase intentions to avoid teenage pregnancy and HIV/STIs by encouraging delayed initiation of sexual intercourse and/or consistent use of contraception and is designed to be delivered in educational settings. It specifically targets boys aged 14–15, however, it can also be delivered to girls and used in same-sex or mixed-class groups. It is designed to promote critical thinking about the social pressures that normally situate teenage pregnancy and its prevention as a female-only issue. Programme components include: an interactive film which tells the story of 16-year-old Jack, who has just found out that his girlfriend Emma is unexpectedly pregnant; classroom materials for teachers containing detailed lesson plans with specific classroom-based and homework activities; a 90-minute training session delivered by RSE specialists to teachers implementing the programme and parent components as described below. The JACK programme and Trial methods are described in full elsewhere [29,30] and more information about the project can found at www.qub.ac.uk/if-i-were-jack. Setting The study was conducted in two countries, Lesotho and South Africa. Lesotho and South Africa differ in terms of culture, language and religion, but they both have very high levels of poverty, unemployment and gender-linked violence [36]. In Lesotho, the study was located in the Maseru district, which consists of the capital city, Maseru (population circa 330,000) and other surrounding peri-urban and rural areas. Lesotho is listed among the ‘least developed countries’ on the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of Official Development Assistance (ODA) recipients. Despite huge need in relation to SRH in Lesotho with services mostly centred in the capital, government expenditure on health overall is only around 5% of gross expenditure [37]. In South Africa, the study was located in the peri-urban informal settlement of Khayelitsha (population circa 500,000), which is situated on the outskirts of Cape Town. While South African law guarantees access to SRH services, there remains a large service gap with an economic status gradient evident in places such as Khayelitsha [6]. We chose to work in these countries for a number of reasons. First, they are home to some of the most vulnerable adolescents in Southern Africa who are very much in need of evidence-based SRH interventions. Second, we thought the differences between them (in particular culture, poverty levels, abortion laws and SRH services provision) would allow identification of key factors that can promote or inhibit adoption, implementation and evaluation during future phases of the study. Importantly, the project team in South Africa also had extensive experience working in both country sites. When compared to the UK, for which the original intervention was designed, South Africa is comparable in terms of reported gender equality indexes, while Lesotho shows stark differences. In 2020, the Global Gender Gap Report [36] ranked the UK 21st out of 153 countries, while South Africa was placed 17th and Lesotho 88th. Further, the report highlights that while 29% of women in the UK and 21% of women in South Africa report ever having experienced gender violence, the figure in Lesotho is 62%. Additionally, while unmet need for family planning in the UK stands at 6%, figures in South Africa (15%) and Lesotho (18%) are higher, as are incidences of maternal mortality (7 per 100,00 live births in the UK compared with 119 in South Africa and 544 in Lesotho). Due to the burden of HIV/AIDS in the region, it is imperative that SRH interventions targeting adolescents incorporate a focus on HIV reduction. For this reason, the adapted intervention will appoint equal focus on the avoidance of HIV/STIs and unintended pregnancy. While we recognise the importance of the full range of contraceptive methods available – the JACK programme encourages the use of condoms alongside another contraceptive method – we focus on condom use because it is the only method of contraception that provides dual protection from STIs and pregnancy. Our definition of ‘unprotected sex’ for this project therefore refers to sex without a condom (‘condomless’ sex). When we refer to ‘contraception’, this includes condoms and all other methods of contraception, unless otherwise specified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
View Point,24th September 2019,,https://www.jsi.com/girls-and-gumboots-keeping-girls-aids-free-in-lesotho/,"Ask anyone in the southern African nation of Lesotho to point out a “gumboot.” They’ll point to a pair of the rubber boots that are seemingly ubiquitous among Lesotho men, a necessary accessory for almost any everyday task. Then again, they are just as likely to show you a condom, a gumboot of a very different kind. These gumboots— likhohlopo in the local Sesotho language—are key to Lesotho’s strategy to control its HIV epidemic. Local chiefs and the Strengthening High Impact Interventions for an AIDS-free Generation (AIDSFree) Project are targeting the country’s western districts with both prevention messages and condoms in their campaign.“Combined prevention messaging and condom distribution are essential to preventing new HIV infections among sexually active men and women in Lesotho,” says Audrey Sullivan, a JSI senior team lead who supports AIDSFree’s HIV-prevention activities in country.Since March of 2018, AIDSFree has worked in urban districts of Maseru and Berea through the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe (DREAMS) project to improve the health and well-being of Lesotho’s adolescent girls and young women. Since the project’s inception, AIDSFree has reached more than 60,000 girls and young women between 15 and 24 with messaging on HIV prevention, basic life skills, and similar topics. The project is funded by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and managed by JSI. In addition to prevention messages for girls and young women, AIDSFree has been distributing condoms in Maseru, Berea, and three rural districts (Leribe, Mafeteng, and Mahale’s Hoek). Between March 2018 and May 2019, AIDSFree distributed 8.2 million condoms through face-to-face interactions and bulk distribution points such as bars, hotels, universities, and local community councils.Epidemic control activities in Lesotho recognize that young women are disproportionately burdened with HIV, and the country leads the region in condom use (40 percent) among women 15–24. However, major challenges persist in this country of 2.3 million. Many HIV-positive residents live in rural areas where the closest health facilities may be miles away by foot or horseback. Knowledge about HIV prevention and transmission in rural areas is low, at only 34 percent among women and 26 percent among men. Rural men most often work in the mountains as herders or look for work in cities. Girls often marry as early as 15 and remain at home taking care of children. Gender-based violence (GBV) is prevalent in these communities and is a major HIV risk among young women.The project engages village chiefs and community leaders—whose support is critical to community acceptance—to convey information on how to prevent HIV and GBV. Consistent with DREAMS’ holistic approach to HIV prevention, AIDSFree uses creative methods to reach and empower adolescent girls and young women. For example, when a teachers’ strike curtailed outreach in schools, trained facilitators started extracurricular kids’ clubs to teach basic life skills. In another instance, when the AIDSFree team needed interns, it worked with TouchRoots Africa, another nongovernmental organization, to hire 17 young women to fill the positions. Within six months, one of the interns had found a permanent job doing similar work at another organization. Awareness of condoms and prevention messaging is high in Lesotho, but so are troubling myths, including that condoms have worms, transmit HIV, and cause kidney disease. “The highland communities where we work are remote and difficult to reach. Members of these communities are deprived of health information and services,” says Sullivan. “Outreach agents dispel these myths and demonstrate how to use condoms effectively. We engage the community’s leaders to ensure prevention messages receive their endorsement and support.”

Girls Globe,3rd January 2015,,https://www.girlsglobe.org/2015/01/03/be-brave-lesothos-youth-standing-up-against-gender-based-violence/,"Despite the end of the international campaign for 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence, a group of youth in Lesotho have responded to live out this call to action 365 days of the year. Each December, beneficiaries of Help Lesotho’s Child Sponsorship Program pack their bags and head to Help Lesotho headquarters in a town called Hlotse, for a five-day overnight leadership camp.  Child Sponsorship supports children in rural communities who have no other source of funds to pay their prohibitive high school fees; it is the only option for continuing school for many children. The majority of sponsored children are girls due to their increased vulnerability to poverty and HIV/AIDS.The theme of the Leadership Camp 2014 was Be Brave: Stand up, speak out against gender based violence. The camp coincided with the United Nations’ international campaign, 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence, which runs from Nov. 25-Dec.10 each year.For most children, attending camp is the highlight of their year. They spend their days making crafts, playing sports and learning about HIV/AIDS prevention, sexual reproductive health and gender equality. Camp provides the children a welcomed break from the constant challenges of their lives.Inequality in LeosthoGender inequity continues to persist in Lesotho and in many cases acts of violence go unreported due to the lack of knowledge of human rights and fear of the ramifications of reporting. Gender based violence is embedded in Basotho culture due to traditional practices and patriarchal values, which fuel male domination over women and children. This often results in mental illness, STIs, early pregnancies, HIV/AIDS infections and suicide. Help Lesotho is celebrating 10 years of empowering women and girls in Lesotho and is committed to educating on gender equity in all of its programming.Camp staff, made up of mainly young adults from Lesotho, leapt at the chance to educate and empower the vulnerable children, believing that the life skills, HIV/AIDS prevention and sexual reproductive health education provided would change their lives for the better. They led sessions on topics such as, Self Identity and Self Esteem, Resisting Peer Pressure, Sexual Consent, Implications of Teenage Pregnancy and Sex Exploitation, Rape, Gender Violence.Peer-to-peer ModelHelp Lesotho utilizes the effectiveness of peer education, which allowed the teenage campers to feel comfortable asking the camp staff difficult questions on topics such as sex, dating and sexual violence. These topics are taboo in Basotho culture and are often not addressed by parents or teachers, which results in children growing up to believe cultural myths and misconceptions about sexual reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.“When it comes to gender based violence, the Basotho don’t talk about it because of our cultural practices. At Help Lesotho, we are saying: do something, act now,” – Sello Matsoso, camp director.The participants took action to “Be Brave,” by venturing out to local villages to share the lessons learned at camp and encourage the community to fight against gender based violence. “Gender based violence breaks families in so many different ways. We are trying to build capacity for communities to come together and solve their problems,” said Matsoso.Community InvolvementHelp Lesotho worked with village chiefs to organize these community gatherings, called lipitso [de-pitso], where the campers gave speeches, performed original songs, dramas and poems to educate on the effects of gender based violence. One group performed a skit on domestic abuse and demonstrated how it affects the children’s mental health and performance in school.After the presentations, the campers facilitated a community discussion in the form of a question and answer session. At one village, a woman shared about her daughter’s rape by a neighbour. The group provided the woman with support and advice on how to help her daughter heal and encouraged her to press charges against the neighbour. At another village, a young woman asked how she could prevent sexual harassment in her village, and young men asked questions about sexual consent and realized they were committing rape when they demand sex without consent.The campers acknowledged that their voices will be heard when they speak up and they have the power to make changes and save lives. They committed to stopping gender based violence in their communities – 365 days a year",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,24th July 2018,,https://www.pih.org/article/treating-mind-and-body-mental-health-care-expanding-lesotho,"It was a story no doctor wants to tell. But at Botšabelo Hospital in Maseru, Lesotho, during a recent training on mental health care, a doctor related the story of a man who had successfully completed two grueling years of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, or MDR-TB—only to succumb to a different, devastating illness, that far too often goes unseen.  That illness was mental, rather than physical, and likely involved severe depression. After beating MDR-TB by taking thousands of pills and enduring frequent, painful injections along with side effects including nausea, the patient was discharged by doctors at Botšabelo and returned to his home. It was only there that, unemployed and lacking a support system of family nd friends, he took his own life. One-fifth of Lesotho’s 2.2 million people suffer from mental illness, according to a 2016 study led by Dr. Daniel Vigo of the Harvard School of Public Health, in work supported by PIH. That’s the highest rate of mental illness of any country in which Partners In Health works—but mental health is a need that crosses every border.  Lesotho lso has one of the highest HIV rates in the world, affecting one in four people. Infectious diseases such as HIV and TB, and their treatments, are significantly affected by mental health, and mental illness. “Mental health is the biggest total burden of disease, globally,” said Dr. Bepi Raviola, PIH’s director of mental health. “And diseases such as HIV and TB cannot be eated most effectively without considering mental health.”That’s why PIH is ramping up its mental health programs in Lesotho and at PIH sites around the world, by training more providers to incorporate mental health into primary care and improving diagnosis and treatment for illnesses including depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and more.Dr. Melino Ndayizigiye is linical director for Bo-mphato Litsebeletsong tsa Bophelo, as PIH is known in Lesotho. He said the integration of care is vital in a country where the only mental health professionals are psychiatric nurses—usually just one or two for every 200,000 people, he added—and where many communities are in remote areas far from the nearest health facility. “We cannot separate treatment of mind and body,” Ndayizigiye said. The May mental health training in Lesotho, during which a doctor shared the tragic story of a patient’s suicide, was one part of an ongoing effort to bridge that gap, and followed a previous training there in August 2017. Dr. Stephanie Smith, associate director of mental health for PIH, led the first training session, while Dr. Todd Holzman, a Boston-based psychiatrist, led the second. Doctors and nurses participated at Botšabelo Hospital in Maseru, Lesotho’s capital, and at a regional hospital in the district of Mohale’s Hoek, south of Maseru. The trainings’ goals included raising clinicians’ awareness of mental illness among  patients and improving their diagnostic skills. They learned to screen patients and monitor progress, identify symptoms of depression during pregnancy, and recognize common mental health concerns among different age groups. Holzman said that, ultimately, much of the work is rooted in listening to patients, asking them how they’re feeling, and understanding the social and familial scenarios that can affect their health. Some people might show signs of depression that actually stem from medical conditions. “Be sure you eliminate that possibility before you initiate treatment,” Holzman said. “A depressed mood can be caused by a number of medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, early pancreatic cancer, or Parkinson’s disease—to name just a few.” Dr. Lawrence Oyewusi, MDR-TB program manager at Botšabelo, said his staff appreciated the sessions.  “It was an intensive training but interactive, where people were able to discuss, share their experiences and ask questions,” Oyewusi said. Staff at Botšabelo said some MDR-TB patients can exhibit severe depression or even psychotic behavior as a side effect of the powerful drugs, and pression also can affect patients’ families. Several doctors emphasized the need to strengthen mental health training and extend care not only to patients, but also to family members and caregivers. “Given that patients suffering with MDR-TB and HIV/AIDS are desperate, often depressed, and already taking more than a dozen medications daily, it is essential that we raise the capacity of health care providers at all levels to screen for psychiatric disorders, especially depression,” Ndayizigiye said. Oyewusi’s team has a plan in place to screen all patients for mental health. He said that, anecdotally, depression is the most prevalent mental health disorder at Botšabelo, where patients struggle with two years of treatment coupled with high co-infection rates for HIV, diabetes, renal failure and more. He said the screening process will provide stronger data for rates of depression and other mental health disorders. More successful treatments and broader awareness about mental illnesses also could go a long way toward changing societal perceptions.Smith told Botšabelo staff that stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness can create significant barriers to treatment.  “Stigma can lead to neglect, physical abuse, denial of access to help and a violation of an individual’s human right to quality health care,” she said. “It’s important that we address stigma on all levels. Getting people the treatment they need, including successful reintegration into the unity, demonstrates that mental disorders are treatable. That is one of the most important stigma-busting activities that we can support.” PIH is spreading that message on an increasingly large scale. PIH’s largest mental health programs are in Haiti and Rwanda, which each have more than 3,000 patients. Socios En Salud, as PIH is known in Peru, has expanded its rogram significantly in recent years and is piloting a safe house program, for example, that the government has adopted and is scaling nationally, to 350 locations. Compañeros En Salud, as PIH is known in Mexico, has incorporated mental health care since 2011, when it began operating in the mountainous region of Chiapas, and also has expanded its program in recent ars. PIH also is supporting growing mental health programs in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Malawi. Often, that growth is from the ground up. Raviola said in most countries where PIH is supporting the development of mental health care, the field is not taught in medical or nursing schools. Nearly all patients have few, if any, options for treatment.  “In the countries where we work, we’re often starting from scratch, but, in collaboration with local Ministry of Health teams, we’re making rapid progress in piloting effective, community-based mental health care delivery systems,” Raviola said. Additionally, in collaboration with a new Harvard University initiative called GlobalMentalHealth@Harvard, PIH is bringing together front-line organizations who are proving that mental health treatment can be delivered in low-resource settings. In June, Raviola and Professor Vikram Patel of Harvard Medical School— supported by the Harvard Medical School Center for Global Health Delivery-Dubai—led a meeting focused on increasing the role of community health workers in mental health care. Representatives from all PIH sites participated, along with leading researchers and members of nongovernmental organizations in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Oyewusi said that in Lesotho, improving the availability and quality of mental health care comes down to a universally common need: more resources. Specifically, he said, more “staff, space, supplies and systems.” That PIH mantra applies to health care delivery across the board, whether it’s for TB, HIV, maternal health or mental health. And the same motivation for that care—that health is a human right—applies to mental health as much as any other condition.“People get better,” Raviola said, “and it has a truly remarkable and transformative effect on attitudes and beliefs.”

UNFPA,12th August 2020,Matseliso Motsoane,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/perspectives-young-people-youth-day,"It has been about 9 months since a delegation of young people from Lesotho including myself, attended the ICPD25 Summit in Nairobi. The international conference convened with the aim of addressing the broad Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) issues affecting people across all age groups around the world. As young Basotho people we went there with a lot to say, and a lot to learn. We returned having made the vow to accelerate the promise made in Cairo 25 years before, by being more proactive in our communities about issues of Sexual reproductive health, Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Sexuality.Since then we have however been hit by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this resulted in an even tougher environment to address these issues and combat harmful practices. We have seen a rise in GBV numbers due to women being confined to their homes with abusive partners and family members. Nonetheless Lesotho has seen some progress.There have been a number of initiatives, particularly in the community where I now live in Morija, to create sustainable and reusable pads as a way to make menstrual care more accessible to all, despite the economic challenges the pandemic has brought on.Furthermore, my colleagues in the LGBTI+ community have made great strides in building awareness around issues of mental health and sexuality. In fact, every now and again when you turn on any of the local radio stations, you will hear an advert building awareness about the intimate social challenges that the LGBTI+ community faces due to the country’s pervasive stigma. This small feat has really gone a long way in opening up the Basotho population to the issues that the LGBTI+ community has been facing. All in all, I would say it is difficult to measure exactly what our progress is in accelerating the ICPD promise, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the same delegation remains committed to realising that promise and we look forward to more engagements with young people at grassroots level about these issues. We have also acquired a unique set of skills and resources that allow us to continue this work, even in this ‘new normal’ that we all have to readjust to.

UNFPA,31st July 2023,Leribe,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/young-people-express-own-views-gender-equality,"Young people from various facets of life engaged in conversations and discussions on Gender Equality as part of commemoration of World Population Day this year. Ahead of the commemoration at Ha Khabo in Leribe district, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund partnered with Limkokwin University of Creative Technology to host a dialogue for young people to dissect this year’s theme, ""Unleashing the power of gender equality: Uplifting the voices of women and girls to unlock our world’s infinite possibilities."" During this dialogue, discussions were mostly on unpacking what the theme means and how Lesotho would advance should the power of gender equality be unleashed. As one of the young people Zwelithini Matsoso stated, “to us unleashing gender equality in Lesotho means removing barriers that among other things limit distribution of resources and unleashing the power of gender equality means unlocking both national and human resources because if we invest in humans, in young people’s education, that means we will end up with a competent and powerful resource that would contribute to our economy.” He continued, “Investing in gender equality is about removing barriers, about unlocking not only the human development but also national development as a whole because in the end, as a country we need to harvest proceeds from the existence of the population which sometimes we refer to as the Demographic Dividend. As we invest and bridge those inequalities in the economic sphere, we will end up with young people that are able to amass assets such as land.Discussion also focused on participation of women in the country’s political activities particularly representation of women in leadership positions. One of the young people Nteboheleng Makae elaborated, “Lesotho is still lagging behind when it comes to Gender Based Violence (GBV) and gender equality. We are still behind. Women participation in political leadership positions like in local government is still minimal.”The young people also focused on “Bodily Autonomy.” As one of them Thato Thinyane asserted, “Bodily autonomy is about the right to my own body. It’s about choice, dignity.” The young people also emphasized on the need to have relevant knowledge and information, the right to be able to make their own choices, and for men to understand that a No to sex is a No.At Ha Khabo where the commemoration was held, young people repeatedly called for women and girls voices to be heard. ‘When no one listens to the voices of women and girls, it is deadly as some may be sexually assaulted and be afraid to report. Also, for those that are LGBITQ+ if parents and the public do not accept them, some of them opt to committing suicide for fear of being ridiculed. One of the young people Kefuoe Majoro emphasized on political participation saying, “In Local Government, people tend to elect men even when women have better qualifications just because they are men. We should try to balane in local government elections. We should elect women – there is need for women’s participation.”Another young person Lerato Motleleng said, “when parents force young girls into marriage, sometimes for economic reasons, such girls end up being pregnant too early when their bodies are not ready resulting in them sometimes losing their lives.” young people at Ha Khabo were sensitized and trained on issues that affect adolescents and youth during the two days prior to the commemoration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNFPA,11th October 2022,,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/international-day-girl-0,"Today, as we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the International Day of the Girl, how many ten-year-old girls are able to look forward to realizing their full potential? A girl’s life should begin the way every life should: as an open book in which she writes her own story. If, as she moves through life chapter by chapter, she is nurtured, encouraged and supported, she has a greater chance of recognizing that she deserves opportunities and options, of considering herself worthy and valued, and of participating in and contributing her gifts to the world. For it is these girls who grow up to become women making laws and making noise, breaking records and breaking barriers, and inspiring movements and igniting change. From protesting to leading countries, they tell the next generation of girls: Take up space. This is your world too.  Yet, from the moment a girl takes her first breath, she is already at a disadvantage simply because she was born a girl. Globally, almost twice as many girls aged 15 – 19 are not in employment, education or training compared to boys the same age. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and climate change are increasing the threats girls face. Before the pandemic, 100 million girls were projected to be at risk of child marriage over the next 10 years; pandemic-related poverty and education disruptions have added 10 million more girls to that figure. For girls in humanitarian settings, these risks are even greater.
We must act with urgency and commitment to end child marriage. And we must tackle its root cause: gender inequality. If all girls completed secondary school, child marriage would fall by 66 per cent. By investing in quality education, ensuring decent work for women, and dismantling harmful gender norms and stereotypes, we can give girls the future they deserve.
We are making headway and there are some positive stories to tell. In 2021, the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to End Child Marriage and its partners provided almost 2.6 million adolescent girls with life skills and comprehensive sexuality education, which empowers them to make choices about their bodies and futures. We engaged nearly 16 million people in dialogues on child marriage, the rights of adolescent girls and the importance of gender equality. We worked to improve access to school and to adolescent-friendly health services. And yet, we are nowhere near finished. There are more than 600 million adolescent girls globally. They have hopes to fulfill and dreams to realize. Every single one of us can commit to being their allies and champions. Instead of sidelining a girl, shine a spotlight on her. Instead of silencing her, hand her a microphone.  Hear what she has to say. Give her the chance to chart her destiny and be a force for positive change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It drives the message that women, girls, racial and ethnic minorities, the LGBTQ+ community, and other marginalized groups are undervalued, exploited, and violated online. The ambition is for everyone to join the movement to hold policymakers, companies, and individuals to account.“Relentless, borderless, and often anonymous – the online world is the new frontier for gender-based violence,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “It’s time for technology companies and policymakers to take digital violence seriously. Right now, corporate logos and copyrighted IP receive greater protection online than we do as human beings.”The reality: people do not own their bodies online
Reports of online harassment are widespread. From cyberstalking and hate speech to doxxing and the non-consensual use of images and video—such as deepfakes—online violence is rife.According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, 85% of women with access to the internet reported witnessing online violence against other women, and 38% experienced it personally. Around 65% of women surveyed have experienced cyber-harassment, hate speech and defamation, while 57% have experienced video and image-based abuse and ‘astroturfing’, where damaging content is shared concurrently across platforms.1In many countries, laws do not exist to make online violence illegal. Anyone who tries to remove exploitative images of themselves will find they have few legal rights, and a long, painful process awaits those who try to enforce what rights they do have. However, when someone infringes on music or film copyright, digital platforms remove the content immediately. Governments have passed laws making copyright infringement illegal and digital platforms have devised ways to identify and prevent unauthorized use of copyrighted material. These same protections and repercussions should extend to individuals and their photos.Nine out of 10 women (92%) report online violence harms their sense of well-being and over a third (35%) have experienced mental health issues due to online violence. This trauma inhibits authentic self-expression, and adversely impacts the professional and economic livelihoods of people who depend on online and social media spaces. Online violence silences the voices of women.The bodyright Campaign The heart of the bodyright movement is the  symbol, which can be added to any image directly via Instagram stories using stickers, or by going to the bodyright webpage to use the automatic ‘bodyright tool’ or to download the symbol  directly. All assets and guidance can be found at www.unfpa.org/bodyright. To launch the campaign UNFPA has partnered with award winning poet and spoken-word artist Rakaya Fetuga (Instagram handle: @rakayaesime). From London and of Ghanaian and Nigerian heritage, Rakaya authored and performed spoken-word poetry communicating the impact of online violence and the concept of bodyright. The bodyright launch video can be seen here. To further advocate for action from governments, policymakers, tech companies and social media platforms, UNFPA has launched a petition, hosted by Global Citizen, demanding tangible action to end digital violence and abuse. 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence The social campaign will launch during the 16 Days of Activism against Violence Against Women (25 November – 10 December 2021) with additional supporting activity taking place in 2022. As part of the global 16 Days of Activism, UNFPA has also launched “The Virtual Is Real” a website that features stories of victims and survivors of digital violence from around the world, alongside innovative work done by UNFPA to address this human rights violation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With input from local keholders, FANTA recently drafted a 5-day training of trainers (TOT) curriculum on NACS for the MOH. The first TOT held in May served as a pre-test of the new curriculum and included participants from the MOH Family Health, Community Health, and Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) departments, district-level nutritionists, and staff from organizations supporting nutrition interventions. For the Lesotho training, FANTA drew from its vast experience developing NACS materials in several countries. The NACS guidelines, training materials, and job aids have helped program planners and implementers better design and integrate all the elements of NACS into local health care and community services. The 5-day workshop included a half-day site visit practicum during which participants practiced measuring and classifying nutritional status, delivering health education talks, and providing nutritional counseling at a health facility. In addition, the participants were given the opportunity to practice facilitating selected training modules throughout the week.Upon completion of the workshop, participants demonstrated increased knowledge of the causes and consequences of malnutrition in HIV-affected populations and improved skills in nutritional assessment and classification and nutrition counseling.FANTA is currently finalizing the TOT curriculum and will assist the MOH in conducting the first training for health workers later this year. Once the curriculum is finalized, the MOH plans to adopt the curriculum as the national standard for NACS training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The New Humaniterian ,22nd February 2011,,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/report/92002/lesotho-better-coordination-could-save-lives-mothers,"A new joint programme is changing the way the Lesotho government and its development partners deliver aid by getting different government departments, UN agencies and civil society organizations working together to help mothers and their families. Tens of thousands of Basotho already depend on food and agricultural assistance as well as free HIV/AIDS treatment, but the country is no closer to achieving a number of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and progress on some has reversed.Over half the population lives in extreme poverty, an estimated 23 percent of adults are infected with HIV, and for every 100,000 live births, 1,155 women died during or after delivery in 2009; up from 762 in 2004.“Because we’re looking at negative trends in these areas, we discussed with the government and I think there was consensus that there was something we weren’t doing right,"" said Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onochie, the UN resident coordinator in Lesotho.Starting in June 2010, the joint programme began targeting the four worst performing MDGs - those relating to the eradication of poverty and hunger, to reducing child and maternal mortality and combating HIV - in the four worst performing of Lesotho's 10 districts. The best chance of success, everyone agreed, was to focus interventions on helping mothers. Research has shown that improving their lives has a knock-on effect on other family members.The programme also tries to address the lack of coordination and wasted resources that have plagued aid delivery in the past.Joint assessmentsTake for example Mphu Mopeli*, who is seven months pregnant with her fifth child and living with HIV. Her only income comes from collecting and selling firewood to her neighbours and the small amount her two sons earn working as herd boys. Like many others in her district of Thaba-Tseka, one of Lesotho’s most remote and impoverished areas, she might not make it without outside help.Previously, that help would have come, if it came at all, from various sources - the local clinic, the UN World Food Programme (WFP), and extension officers from the Ministry of Agriculture. Mopeli may have been listed as a beneficiary by all of these organizations who would have visited her in separate vehicles, asked her similar questions and never shared her responses with one another.Now various UN agencies and government departments are teaming up to carry out joint assessments and agree on the same group of beneficiaries to receive a comprehensive set of services.The health department is working with partners including the World Health Organization and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to identify pregnant, breast-feeding and HIV-positive mothers and their infants who are in need of food rations from the WFP. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) together with the Ministry of Agriculture makes sure the same women receive seeds, tools and advice on how to grow vegetables and raise chickens that may eventually eradicate the need for food assistance. Hard times delay MDGsEventually, some of the women will receive training on how to start small businesses that could permanently lift them and their families out of poverty.""The concentration of complementary activities in a given location for a given population is something we’ve never attempted in a development context,"" said the UN’s Eziakonwa-Onochie. ""The goal is to have greater impact because when you programme in bits and pieces, you miss important components and it's not sustainable or complete.""More efficientShe added that the new approach was also more efficient because it allowed for the sharing of skills and resources. In Thaba-Tseka, officials from the ministries of agriculture and health, as well as from the FAO, WFP and NGO Caritas have formed a nutrition team.""We've tried to mix people from different backgrounds,"" explained Washi Mokati, WFP head of office for the district. ""Previously, different organizations were building keyhole gardens [small raised vegetable gardens] in different styles; now we're bringing similar practices together.""Mokati added that the programme is still in its infancy and faces challenges. The new level of coordination requires ""lots of meetings and not everyone attends"".In charge of coordinating those meetings, both at national and district level, is the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO), a government entity that previously had an uncertain role as one of many government departments dealing with nutrition.""This programme has reaffirmed our coordinating role,"" said FNCO director Masekonyela Sebotsa. ""Our role is bringing everyone together so we work as a team, because often in government each ministry is doing its own work.""Now you might see [officials from] the Ministry of Health and [the Ministry of] Agriculture travelling in one car; now we work as one.""Although the UN is funding the programme until December 2012 as part of its ""Delivering as One"" initiative aimed at encouraging UN agencies to deliver development assistance in a more coordinated way, Eziakonwa-Onochie said their role had mainly be ""catalytical"".By 2012, the programme should have yielded enough results and best practices for government to decide whether to take over and replicate it in other districts.""It needs to be rooted in a national budget,"" Eziakonwa-Onochie told IRIN, ""otherwise we run the risk of starting something that fizzles out.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nurtition International ,13th June 2022,,https://www.nutritionintl.org/news/all-field-stories/access-to-quality-maternal-health-services-is-a-necessity-bangladesh/,"Twenty-five-year-old Moushumi Akter is in the last trimester of her third pregnancy. She is hoping that, unlike her first two, this one will result in the birth of a healthy baby. Her first pregnancies took place early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person antenatal care services were difficult to access, and her family faced added financial strain from lockdown conditions and loss of income. She also wasn’t aware of the increased nutritional needs of her body while pregnant. As she nears her due date, Moushumi is grateful that this experience has been different. Access to quality maternal health services is a foundational necessity for both pregnant women and infants. As a long-time trusted partner of the National Nutrition Service under the Institute of Public Health Nutrition in Bangladesh (IPHN), Nutrition International provides technical and operational assistance to support a positive pregnancy for women and their families. This assistance includes developing nutrition action plans, trainings for community health centres and frontline workers, supporting supply chain management of essential nutrition commodities, behaviour change initiatives to increase uptake and utilization of services, and monitoring of key indicators. All this helps to ensure pregnant women have access to quality maternal health and nutrition services such as antenatal care and iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation.In 2021, Nutrition International launched the COVID-19 Emergency Nutrition Response Project to scale-up essential nutrition services, particularly for women and children who were impacted by the pandemic. Samia Alam, Nutrition International’s Project Officer for the emergency response in Bangladesh, discusses the dangers associated with receiving no form of antenatal care. “It will not be possible to identify if the pregnant woman is anaemic, if her blood pressure is under control, if she is gaining weight properly, or if there are any other risks of preeclampsia, hypertension, or bleeding during pregnancy,” she says. “The woman and her family also won’t be aware of the five danger signs to watch out for during pregnancy that could lead to maternal and infant death.”In September 2021, as part of the project, support services were launched in the Jamalpur and Sherpur districts of Bangladesh, which have some of the highest malnutrition rates in the country. The program was designed to help ensure that pregnant women in both districts saw their local community healthcare workers at least four times throughout their pregnancies so they could receive antenatal care counselling and a recommended supply of IFA tablets, alongside other antenatal care recommendations.Moushumi heard about the program from a relative who had been receiving antenatal care and IFA supplementation. After learning that she had not received these services during her first two pregnancies, her relative encouraged her to visit the health facility. She also brought Moushumi along to the weekly courtyard sessions on her block, where health assistants and family welfare assistants provide health education to pregnant women and their families. This information and guidance convinced Moushumi to seek the necessary maternal health services at the local health facility.Since the start of the pandemic, it’s been a global challenge to get pregnant women like Moushumi to continue accessing maternal health services. Nutrition International and the IPHN identified a fear of contracting COVID-19, shared by both patients and community health practitioners, as a barrier to seeking and receiving antenatal care. “Service providers were afraid during the COVID-19 lockdown period,” says Krishna Paul, Nutrition International’s Emergency Response Grant District Coordinator for Sherpur. “They only provided medicines instead of in-person physical checkups. This also made it difficult for pregnant women to access antenatal services from health facilities before the start of this project.”Nevertheless, the importance of maternal and prenatal health was a challenge that couldn’t be shied away from. The problem was tackled using a two-pronged approach.To ensure pregnant women continued to visit the health facility, they were given a short-ended supply of 30 IFA supplementation tablets during each antenatal counselling visit with their community healthcare provider. Once they ran out, they would return to collect their next 30-day supply and follow up on their antenatal counselling for a minimum of four sessions.To address COVID-19 safety and a fear of in-person contact, pregnant women were also given behaviour change materials developed by Nutrition International to be taken home. These pocket-sized pamphlets contained valuable information about looking out for specific danger signs, nutritional needs for each stage of pregnancy, an IFA supplementation guide, and the timing of their next check-ups – as well as messages for spouses, encouraging them to be active participants in antenatal care. They were designed to provide pregnant women and their spouses with necessary information and help them feel less anxious about needing frequent visits to their healthcare provider.Moushumi expresses that her knowledge, confidence and awareness of her body’s evolving needs have grown since having access to regular counselling sessions and the informative pamphlets. She says the nutritional infographic named “Ammu Ami Boro Hocchi” (Mom, I’m growing up) has been especially helpful in understanding the different stages of pregnancy.After reflecting on her past pregnancies, Moushumi is now outwardly grateful to her supportive healthcare practitioners that have held her hand throughout this transformational journey. She is dedicated to following all the counselling guidelines and recommendations from her medical team. Moushumi has made it a personal goal to share her profound experience with other soon-to-be-mothers, neighbours and close relatives. With a due date quickly approaching, Moushumi reminds herself of the message she’s been waiting to hear for two years: Ammu Ami Boro Hocchi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alliance For Science,"10th May, 2023",,https://allianceforscience.org/blog/2023/05/lesotho-targets-adolescent-girls-and-mothers-in-18-million-dollar-program-to-end-malnutrition/,"Lesotho has committed 18.8 million dollars towards ending malnutrition, with adolescent girls being the main focus of the program.The southern African kingdom of 2.3 million people received a 22 million loan from the World Bank and a 4.4 million-dollar co-financing grant from the Power of Nutrition for the program.Both monies are for the Lesotho Nutrition and Health System Strengthening Project, which aims to implement the National Food and Nutrition Strategy.“Some of the money will be used to purchase equipment for food production, while some will go to national campaigns and nutrition education, which will be driven by nutritionists, nutrition clubs, and village health workers,” said Mokhothu Makhalanyane, the chair of the National Assembly’s Social Cluster.“All national nutrition-related issues will be integrated into health, education, and agriculture.” Makhalanyane added that the policy direction would target pregnant women, children under the age of five, adolescents, and patients.The project will also involve strengthening community-based nutrition service delivery in districts with high stunting rates.It will target nutrition-specific interventions, including adolescent and maternal dietary supplementation, treatment of severe acute malnutrition, and disease prevention and management. In Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan II, which ends this year, King Letsie III urged the government to work towards reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.King Letsie III is the African Union Champion for Nutrition, Food and Agriculture and a Special Ambassador on Nutrition and Human Capital Champion of the World Bank.Makhalanyane stressed that nutrition clubs in villages and schools will provide education about nutrition and assist people to get into small-scale agriculture as a measure to address malnutrition at household levels.“The issue of malnutrition is complicated. To get it right, all children need to access nutritious food in schools through school-feeding programs. We are trying but the money is inadequate thus the school feeding programs are implemented under very limited budgets,” he said.“At the moment, a child gets a meal that costs 19 cents but each one of them is supposed to get a meal that costs 33 cents. This happens because we cannot afford the nutritious food that is required.”To ensure that the money is properly utilized, Makhalanyane said the Social Cluster will track the progress of different projects.“The monitoring would look at the number of people reached and the spending. There is a team with officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the ministries of Agriculture, Education, and Health tasked with doing the monitoring,” he said.No progress has been made toward achieving the target of reducing anemia among women of reproductive age.

Partners in Health,29th April 2016,,https://www.pih.org/article/accompaniment-in-action-a-baby-is-born-safely-in-lesothos-mountains,"Matumelo Seiiso was expecting her third baby last fall. The 30-year-old mother lived in Nkau, a remote region in the mountains of southern Lesotho. Throughout her pregnancy, Seiiso’s maternal health assistant, Mamopeli Chabana, made regular house calls to check up on her. She also traveled with her to her prenatal appointments at Nkau Health Center, a clinic supported by Partners In Health—known locally as Bo-Mphato Litšebeletsong tsa Bophelo. One night near the end of Seiiso’s pregnancy, Chabana received an alarming phone call. Seiiso was bleeding profusely. Chabana rushed to her house and became frightened as soon as she saw Seiiso, unsure if the baby was coming, but certain something was wrong. A neighbor drove them to the clinic in Nkau, 30 minutes away. Seiiso continued to bleed.An ultrasound revealed Seiiso had a placental abruption, a serious complication that could mean her baby would become deprived of oxygen and nutrients. She needed a cesarean section, but the clinic didn’t stock her blood type. So staff members prepared to send her to a hospital in the capital city, Maseru, and hooked her up to an IV. But before the ambulance arrived, Seiiso began to deliver her baby. Nurses and nurse-midwives got to work, and shortly after, Seiiso gave birth to a healthy girl, Lineo.Despite her mother suffering a placental abruption, Lineo Seiiso was born safely thanks to staff at Nkau Health Center. Photo by Rebecca E. Rollins / Partners In HealthMany women in Lesotho cope with the risks of pregnancy alone, receiving no skilled health care while pregnant and often delivering at home. For this reason, maternal mortality in the country is one of the highest in the world. More than 20,000 women die every year from pregnancy-related complications. PIH has been in Lesotho since 2006 working to change this. By supplying rural clinics with proper medicines and equipment, training doctors, nurses, and midwives, and recruiting community members as maternal health assistants, PIH staff ensure women are properly cared for throughout their pregnancies.PIH’s maternal health work was recognized by Lesotho’s Ministry of Health as a promising model to apply to the rest of the country, and now similar programs are developing at other public clinics.However, we know there is more work to do. Continuing to train maternal health workers to care for women, and further equipping clinics with necessary items—including limitless stocks of blood types for patients—are ongoing goals. But Seiiso’s story shows what an attentive assistant, trained clinicians, and a clean nearby health center can do. They ensured her and her baby’s survival.Seiiso spent several days at Nkau to rest and recover. Six weeks later she returned for Lineo’s final postnatal checkup. While waiting for her appointment, Seiiso recalled the terrifying moments at the clinic and her relief when it was all over.“I was happy, because I was still alive and had a live baby.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jhpiego,"14th March, 2017",,https://www.jhpiego.org/story/expanding-access-to-postpartum-family-planning/,"Today is a day that would change Alizata Ouedraogo’s life. Just a few hours earlier, the 33-year-old mother received a postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD) during a visit to her local health provider. “I’m tired. Four children, that’s enough,” said Ouedraogo, when asked why she and her husband had chosen this long-acting, reversible family planning method. Now, she won’t have to worry about an unintended pregnancy. Ouedraogo and her husband are not alone. Throughout Burkina Faso, there is a high unmet need for family planning, something that midwife Moussa Gansonre, Ouedraogo’s health care provider, is committed to changing. In his practice at the District Hospital of Bogodogo in Ouagadougou, he is dedicated to assuring that his clients are safe and healthy. But, he also considers family planning vital to the country’s future and health: “Family planning is important for our country. We would like to be able to manage ourselves, and this starts with family planning because there are too many children and few resources.”On this November day, Gansonre greeted his client draogo, who had swaddled her 40-day-old son on her back with hand-embroidered shawls that she also sells. Although the midwife towers over his petite client, his gentle demeanor and easy laugh shine through as they talk. Ouedraogo then sits and holds the baby against her chest. When he starts to fuss, she bounces him on her lap.Woman smiling and holding baby After giving birth to her fourth child, Alizata Ouedraogo decided on a long-acting family planning method. Photo by Charles Wanga The 40-year-old father of three breaks into a big smile as he proudly explained that he’s a “sage-homme,” or male midwife. Gansonre, a trained nurse, had not considered the profession of midwifery to be a man’s place. That all changed in 2001 when a male midwife provided critical care to Gansonre’s wife Mariam during the very difficult delivery of their firstborn. “It was by chance that the midwife was passing through the health facility that day,” Gansonre said. “If he hadn’t delivered the baby, things would have gone bad.” This chance encounter had inspired Gansonre to return to school to become a midwife himself. After graduating from Burkina Faso’s National Public Health School in 2009, Gansonre began his new career at the district hospital that today boasts about 400 deliveries a month. Health care providers at the hospital have ample opportunity to discuss possible postpartum family planning (PPFP) methods with their clients before childbirth, during antenatal care visits, and after delivery during postnatal care visits. After this counseling, clients then can select the contraceptive method that best suits their families’ needs. The country has great potential for using PPFP methods, with an overall fertility rate of 6 children per woman and 6.7 children per woman in rural areas—where three-quarters of the population lives—and an unmet need for family planning of 24 percent. In addition, 81 percent of Burkinabe women in the postpartum period have a need for family planning because they do not want another pregnancy in the two years after a birth. “Mothers understand that it’s necessary to space their births. It allows them to continue working,” Gansonre said.  Recognizing women’s unmet need for family planning, the government of Burkina Faso, with support from Jhpiego, launched an ambitious initiative to ensure that health care providers have the skills to provide quality PPFP services to couples who want to plan for the size of their families in a safe and healthy manner. After the London Family Planning Summit in 2012, Jhpiego committed $200,000 to support PPFP methods, particularly long-acting ones like the PPIUD Ouedraogo received. Between 2013 and 2015, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Jhpiego implemented a pilot project at five health care facilities and then extended it to 21 additional sites with funding from the United Nations Population Fund. As a result of this effort, 11,333 women benefited from PPFP counseling. Of these women, 1,629 (14.4 percent) chose and received PPIUDs; data on other contraceptive methods chosen were not readily available. This success then helped garner funding from an anonymous donor to further improve access to PPFP. With this additional funding, Jhpiego, again in collaboration with the health ministry, has worked to enhance the project, which will run through March 2018. Together, they sought to integrate PPFP into the existing maternal and newborn services by strengthening educational institutions’ capacity to teach this essential component of reproductive, maternal and newborn health. Jhpiego is also training health care providers, like Gansonre, who are already on the job. “The training was really rich,” said Gansonre, who attended the skills-building session in 2014. “We practiced in the field and just one week later, we were using our new skills at work.” “Now we are seeing so many women leave the facility satisfied with their choice of a long-acting family planning method. They have no fear of getting pregnant while they have small babies and are still breastfeeding,” said Dr. Tsigue Pleah, a Jhpiego family planning expert who has worked in Burkina Faso and throughout West Africa. “This will allow the women to gain economic independence by leading small businesses, for example, and contributing financially to their families.” Burkina Faso was among 16 countries to send a delegation to the June 2015 PPFP Global Meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and the country has emerged as having one of Jhpiego’s most innovative PPFP programs in West Africa. Gansonre is inspired by the potential of his country: “We know that family planning reduces maternal mortality by 30%. We have a lot to gain.” When asked what she dreams for her children, Ouedraogo looks shyly over at Gansonre and says, “I want them to be like this man here because he has saved us with family planning. I would like them to study and to have a job like him.” Ouedraogo then easily balances her baby on her back as he stares wide-eyed and grinning. She ties him securely to her, covering him well. She says goodbye to Gansonre as she gets on her motorbike. The baby softly cries as the motorbike kicks up dust and his mother rides off. Gansonre then turns to greet a young woman, his next client, with a smile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNFPA,14th September 2022,Motebang Hospital in Leribe district,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/lesotho-introduces-immediate-postpartum-family-planning-services-hospitals,"After delivering her fifth child at Motebang Hospital in Leribe district, 33-year-old ‘Mathabo*decided together with her husband, to immediately start using contraceptives to avoid an unplanned pregnancy. A day after the birth, whilst still in hospital, she inserted the contraceptive implant – Implanon. She was at the hospital to deliver her baby during introduction of immediate postpartum family planning by the Ministry of Health, under the support of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund. The initiative began in Qacha’s Nek and Mokhotlong last year and was implemented in Butha- Buthe and Leribe districts in August this year.  “I will now be able to raise my children well without fear of falling pregnant and will not have to miss work to go for family planning services regularly because the implant will last three years,” she said. Women like ‘Mathabo, who work at the garment factories in Lesotho, often have their pay cut for days on which they miss work, due to the no work, no pay policy at the factories. “I am going to encourage others to use the implant as it is long term” My husband had actually asked me to find a suitable method of family planning and this is it. I am going to encourage others to use the implant as it is long term and to also not listen to those who give them false information.” Thato* also inserted the implanon after giving birth at Motebang hospital. She was happy that since the method is long term (three years), she would save money as she would make fewer visits to the clinic. “I was using another method of family planning but because it had run out of stock I stayed without any contraceptive for six months, that is when I fell pregnant,” she pointed out.   sinkUNFPA is supporting Lesotho in introduction of postpartum family planning - the initiation and use of family planning services immediately after childbirth and within the first 12 months following childbirth to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality by preventing unplanned and unwanted pregnancies and to reduce unmet need for family planning among post-partum women. As the Sexual and Reproductive Health Manager at the Ministry of Health Ms Motsoanku ‘Mefane stated, the intention is to strengthen program implementation of family planning and eventually contribute to FP indicators, create more opportunities for women to initiate family planning methods before they leave the health facility and sharpen service providers’ skills and competences on FP. “Also, we want to offer them the family planning services while they are still at the health facility after child birth because they may face many different challenges that may refrain them from getting back to the facility for family planning after they leave,” she added.  Increasing Contraceptive Use Since the initiative to offer modern contraception services as part of care provided during childbirth is expected to also ncrease contraceptive use and reduce both unintended pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, it is considered to be even more advantageous to adolescents and young people. According to a Nurse working at the Adolescent Health Corner at Motebang hospital Ms ‘Makhauta Litaolana, the introduction of postpartum family planning will help in educing unintended pregnancies which sometimes lead to illegal abortions that are also sometimes fatal to young people. Recent data obtained from one hospital covering the first quarter (January – March) of 2019, 2020, 2022 revealed that the percentage of obstetric and gynaecological admissions due to abortion were highest among adolescent girls aged 10 -14 at 5.71 percent.The health workers were also refreshed on modern contraceptives to enhance their knowledge and skills during the orientation on postpartum family planning in Butha-Buthe and Leribe hospitals. One of the key aspects of postpartum family planning is to promote long-term methods and less used methods of FP such as IUCD with a particular interest to increase uptake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNFPA,23rd June 2023,Machabeng Hospital,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/nursing-assistants-laud-training-family-planning,"For ‘Makatleho Takana Leteba, a Nursing Assistant at Machabeng Hospital, the training she had recently on Family Planning has been mostly useful for her working in the highland district of Qacha’snek where young girls aged around 14 /15 often give birth at the hospital. The youngest girl she has seen pregnant was a 12-year-old who was brought for Ante Natal Clinic to the hospital by Community Health Workers in February this year. She had gone with other girls to fetch firewood when they were chased by boys. She was unfortunate to be caught by one of them who raped her and made her pregnant. You can imagine, at that age, coming from the rural areas, she did not know much about what was happening,” she said.
The Lesotho Demographic Health Survey (LDHS) 2014 shows that teenage pregnancy in Lesotho is at 19 % and the most affected places are those in the highlands of the country where access to health services is generally difficult.Leteba believes all sectors of society, young girls, boys, men and women must be educated on family planning to counter early and unintended pregnancies which often result in young girls having to stop pursuing their education and marrying at an early age. Child Marriage in Lesotho is estimated at 24%.a doctor writing on a whiteboardAfter the training, she would share the knowledge she gained with her co-workers and also focus on mother in laws as they are also often the decision makers in households. “We had a woman who was bought to the hospital after her mother in law made her push for three days during delivery. By the time she eventually got to the hospital, the baby was on the perineum, already dead,” she stated adding that the woman had to be transferred to T’sepong hospital in Maseru for treatment of Obstetric Fistula.“I am also going to ensure that we intensify the health education we deliver to young people and advise them on different contraceptive methods they could use,” she concluded. Another Nursing Assistant who received the training Ms Moleboheng Nkongoane said the workshop had been very useful to her as she was trained in a Catholic Nursing School where family planning was not done practically. “I learnt the practical aspect of family planning when I got to work,” she said adding that the workshop helped her advance on the knowledge she had.“For example, I was not aware of the other important aspects regarding insertion of implants such as the weight of the woman. I also knew very little about the guidelines. After the training, I will be confident to advice the women on the most suitable contraception method to use.”She also believes parents should be educated on Family Planning so that they can confidently speak to their children and advise them. In particular, men should be trained on the myths and FMs ‘Makamohelo Pitso also a Nursing Assistant who is from Thaba-Tseka also viewed the workshop as very important.  She would advise women back in her district to use long term family planning methods so that they would not have to visit the health facility frequently and thereby safe on transport money. She also emphasised the importance of long term family planning methods.The training follows an End Line Assessment which showed that Family Planning was not integrated and that there was poor quality of data. As a strategy, training was therefore designed for 24 Nursing Assistants from around the country focusing on Family Planning data and commodities.In Lesotho, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund supports the government in efforts to reduce the unmet need for family planning which is currently estimated at 18%.  Access to and use of contraception is an important strategy to reduce maternal mortality in the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jhpiego,,Basotho,https://www.jhpiego.org/countries-we-support/lesotho/,"More than 122,000 Basotho have learned their HIV status through Jhpiego-led initiatives, and over 210,000 men have received voluntary medical male circumcision services, thereby benefiting from this procedure’s protective effect against HIV infection. Jhpiego pioneered the first-ever integrated, comprehensive, nurse-led male clinic, which received over 18,000 patient visits in the first two years. The clinic, which provides client-centered, male-friendly health services and improves male health-seeking behaviors, has been endorsed by the Ministry of Health and is being replicated at 13 primary health care clinics.Jhpiego supported the Lesotho Nursing Council to introduce task shifting for nurse practitioners to establish and implement a sustainable, nurse-led HIV/AIDS response. This includes nurse-initiated and nurse-managed antiretroviral therapy services for people living with HIV, thereby reducing the burden on doctors so they can focus on more advanced care needs.Jhpiego is supporting the Ministry of Health to provide pre-exposure prophylaxis and other combination prevention services to more than 13,000 people at high risk of contracting HIV, primarily adolescent girls and young women.With funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Jhpiego is working in select countries, including Lesotho, to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with ministry of health priorities in each country, RISE’s COVID-19 response support may include: assisting in the planning and rollout of national vaccine plans, including ensuring health care workers are prepared to implement and monitor this plan; providing focused and clinically relevant capacity building for clinicians providing COVID-19 case management; strengthening the oxygen ecosystem; and supporting health care workers in oxygen conservation, rationalization and non-invasive respiratory care.RISE is a five-year global project—funded by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and USAID—that works with countries to achieve a shared vision of attaining and maintaining epidemic control, with stronger local partners capable of managing and achieving results through sustainable, self-reliant and resilient health systems. The project is led by Jhpiego with the following partners: ICAP at Columbia University, Management Sciences for Health, Anova, BAO Systems, Johns Hopkins University Center for Public Health and Human Rights, and Mann Global Health.

Global Sisters Report ,24th October 2022,BEREA PLATEAU,https://www.globalsistersreport.org/news/teen-moms-lesotho-find-shelter-education-local-sisters,"BEREA PLATEAU, Lesotho – Susan tries to smile as she holds her crying baby while seated on a mattress in a small room at Good Shepherd Centre for Teenage Mothers. But it does not entirely erase the pain in her eyes. The 17-year-old dropped out of 10th grade last year after a 30-year-old farm laborer got her pregnant. Her grandmother, with whom she lived, became disappointed after learning she was pregnant and, together with her uncles, chased her out of their home.She sought refuge at the Good Shepherd Centre for Teenage Mothers in Berea Plateau, a small mountainous town about 12 miles from Maseru, the country’s capital. The Good Shepherd Sisters of Quebec of the Lesotho Province run the center, which they founded in 1995. ""I had nowhere to go, but when I arrived at the center, the sisters happily welcomed me,"" she said. ""My relatives told me to leave our home because I would embarrass them. The sisters have been of great help to me. My son is being taken care of at the daycare while I am training in dressmaking."" Susan (who asked not to use her real name) said her problems started at age 4, when her mother left her with her grandmother to go to South Africa to seek a job. She never returned. Susan said her mother's absence greatly contributed to her current situation because she had no one to advise and guide her. ""My uncles used to tell me that my mother abandoned me and went to South Africa for work, and later on, she died of HIV,"" she recalled, tears streaming down her cheeks as she tugged nervously at her blouse. ""I don't think she ever loved me at all."" Susan's story is far from unique: Thousands of girls in this tiny landlocked country in southern Africa are forced to abandon their education as punishment for being pregnant. Because the country's culture discourages premarital sex, a girl who becomes pregnant before marriage is likely to be excluded or banished from her community or family and is referred to as a ""spoiled girl."" Religious sisters try to help these teen mothers with a safe and supportive place to live while they learn to care for themselves and their children. Good Shepherd Sr. Filipina Hlobotsi said most young mothers at the center come from communities with high poverty, HIV and unemployment. In Lesotho, pregnant girls are left on their own and it seems their life is over, she said. ""We started the center because we saw the challenges of teenage mothers,"" said Hlobotsi, the center's outgoing administrator. ""When a girl falls pregnant while still in school, they are sent away, which means their education stops there. Most of them are chased away from their homes, and because of this, they used to come to our convents asking for any help they could get. ""We realized that others were undergoing abortions, and some even died during the process."" The cause of teen pregnancy A United Nations Population Fund report indicates that Lesotho is among the leading countries in early and unintended pregnancies, with the adolescent birth rate at 94 per 1,000 girls age 15-19. Analysts have blamed high poverty and unemployment as the leading causes of early pregnancy in Lesotho, a high-altitude kingdom encircled by South Africa. With a 36% poverty rate, the country of 2.2 million is experiencing nearly 25% unemployment, a rate that is projected to remain high due to the effects of the pandemic. The situation has forced thousands of Basotho (the people of Lesotho) to migrate to neighboring South Africa to work in its mines and as domestic workers to provide for their families back home, Hlobotsi said, a trek that puts women at risk of getting trafficked. The children, meanwhile, are left under a relative's care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNFPA,12th March 2020,HA MOEKETSANE,https://www.unfpa.org/news/climate-change-affected-lesotho-self-injected-contraceptives-empower-women-choose-their-own,"HA MOEKETSANE, Lesotho – Regina Mokoena has seen first-hand how drought and climate change are increasing the demand for family planning in her village. Ms. Mokoena is a local health worker in Ha Moeketsane, in Lesotho’s mountainous rural Mokhotlong District. She says drought is disrupting livelihoods in this farming community, making it harder for parents to support large families.“In these difficult times, it is not easy to look for a job or to get employed when you have many children, especially here in the village,” she said. “Besides, educating children is also very demanding.”During last summer’s cropping season, the district of Mokhotlong was one of the hardest hit by severe drought. Large numbers of livestock – a main source of livelihood – were lost. Ms. Mokoena says the economic uncertainty has fuelled demand for contraceptives among the district’s women, including interest in a new form of family planning uniquely well suited to rural areas without easy access to health services: injectable contraceptives that women can administer themselves.Unmet need for family planningMokhotlong has one of Lesotho’s highest rates of unmet need for family planning. This has led to the highest fertility rate in the country, with each woman having an average of 4.4 children. The gap between actual fertility and a woman’s desired fertility is also the largest, according to a recent household survey. In addition, the district’s teen pregnancy rate is the nation’s second highest, with 24 per cent of girls aged 15-19 having begun childbearing.But these are not just issues in Mokhotlong. Across the country, unsafe abortion is a primary reason for the hospitalization of women and girls, a 2019 Annual Joint Review found.UNFPA is working with the government to expand access to family planning to all women who want it. Voluntary family planning reduces unintended pregnancies, adolescent pregnancies, maternal death and recourse to abortion.The introduction of the self-administered injectable contraceptive is helping to advance this effort by increasing the options available to women.UNFPA and the Ministry of Health have been training health workers like Ms. Mokoena to teach women to inject the contraceptive themselves. Ms. Mokoena says she has been speaking to public gatherings about it, and the response has been largely positive. The self-injected contraceptive is relatively new in the mix of family planning options, but it has already proved popular. Last year, UNFPA procured 13 million units of the contraceptive, and demand continues to outstrip availability.Globally, nearly 40,000 midwives and 48,000 community health workers have been trained by UNFPA to provide this form of family planning.Still, for many women, the thought of administering their own injections is daunting – something to be weighed against the product’s advantages.“I like the new contraceptive as it will help me space my children,” said Thato,* who lives in Mokhotlong. “I am currently afraid to inject myself though. But I guess I will have to overcome my fear to avoid regularly walking for close to an hour to get to the clinic.”The self-injected contraceptive can also reduce stigma, said ‘Manthati Sekoati, the nurse-in-charge at Mapholaneng Clinic in Mokhotlong. Young people are often embarrassed to be seen accessing reproductive health care, she noted, and women face social pressures to have large families. If they can administer their own contraceptives at home, they are more likely to be empowered to choose the size and spacing of their families.Still, do have to make at least one visit to the clinic, Ms. Sekoati said. They have to come to learn how to administer the injection themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women Deliver,26th September 2018,,https://womendeliver.org/how-community-partnerships-prove-essential-in-the-futures-of-young-mothers-in-lesotho/,"The HIV/AIDS pandemic has rendered Lesotho girls vulnerable to teenage pregnancy and early marriages.  Of all pregnancies in Lesotho, 55% are among adolescent girls and young women (20.7% among 15 – 19-year-olds and 34.3% among 20 – 24-year-olds). Of adolescent girls 15 – 19 in Lesotho, 45.9% have had sexual intercourse, of whom one in three has an unmet need of a modern contraceptive method. Butha Buthe and Thaba-Tseka districts report the highest teenage childbearing rates at 25% and 21% respectively and are among the districts with the lowest use of modern contraception. With 25% of people HIV-positive, Lesotho has a significant cohort of youth growing up without parents to teach them basic knowledge about their reproductive health. Early pregnancy among young girls is on the rise and there has been little support, knowledge, or resources to help them live healthy lives with their babies.Five years ago, a Young Mother Support Program was developed for pregnant or lactating new mothers as young as 14 looking for support and information to better care for their children. Local chiefs encouraged pregnant teens and young mothers from their rural villages to participate in weekly community-based support groups to learn about pre- and post-natal care, depression, basic parenting skills, contraceptives, early child development, and prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission. The sessions also encourage peer support, tools for boosting self-esteem, and activities to strengthen their agency and ability to speak up for themselves amid stigmatization, fears and unhealthy myths.While the girls were becoming more confident and informed, community leaders soon realized a critical gap – the engagement of boys and men. In fact, feedback from one community discussion indicated that many of the participating young girls experienced push back from their boyfriends, husbands, and even family members who felt intimidated by changing power dynamics and the girls’ growing confidence.  In some cases, this led to instances of gender based violence and loss of the agency needed to stand up and speak up for themselves.To address this, project staff quickly determined the need to strengthen community partnerships including with local religious leaders, chiefs, school principals and community councils.  We asked: what is your advice in moving forward and supporting these young mothers? Their advice was unanimous: we had to involve the men – not too much as to overshadow the emphasis on the women but enough so that the men felt included, and were made aware of what actually is discussed during the program so that they didn’t ‘imagine’ the worst. They also suggested that we include the mothers-in-laws, who have substantial social power in families in the Basotho culture. These partnership meetings generated challenging discussions about the rights and needs of girl and women. Events were held where girls shared what they were learning and how they needed the community to support them and their babies. Never before had these girls stood before the community to champion their rights and state their needs. It was life changing – not just for the girls but also for community members and leaders.The program continues holding community meetings and has begun initiating advocacy days at the end of the program to further engage stakeholders at all levels. During these days, there are marches, performances, speeches and rallies which further build confidence and solidarity while also encouraging community and family members to directly and publicly support the young girls. Young Mother Program Officer, Shasha Makhauta, says, “We now have community leaders coming to us to praise these young women and stand up for their rights within their communities. They recommend girls to our program with pride. Partnering with community leaders in such a direct way has really made all the difference.” Change is difficult and as this program demonstrated, community level partnerships may be the key to driving sustainable progress.  Everyone needs to be involved. It does take a village!

Pediatrick AIDS Foundation,August 2022,,https://www.pedaids.org/2022/08/04/fresh-from-the-source/,"Breastfeeding is the best and healthiest feeding option for babies, regardless of the mother’s HIV status. Breast milk contains all the water, food, and nutrients to protect the baby from common infections such as diarrheal infection and it ensures that babies receive vital nutrients that are needed for their growth and development to avoid malnutrition. World Breastfeeding Week is commemorated annually in the first week of August to raise awareness of the importance of breastfeeding. This year’s theme is Step-up for Breastfeeding: Educate and Support.In Lesotho, the Ministry of Health Nutritionist ‘Mahlompho Ntai says that this year’s theme focuses on empowering all stakeholders to protect and support breastfeeding mothers wherever they are. For example, supervisors at workplaces, partners and spouses at home, and parents and in-laws in the community should be equipped with information to provide and sustain breastfeeding-friendly environments.Ntai highlights that among the common challenges of exclusive breastfeeding are low-milk supply from mothers (often due to food insecurity); lack of breastfeeding hours at work; and the situation of young mothers who return to school, leaving their babies with their grannies.Ntai says that during Breastfeeding Week, the Mafeteng District in southwest Lesotho will embark on nutrition education at workplaces and will conduct focus group discussions in communities where there are breastfeeding support groups—to talk to mothers-in-laws, fathers-in-laws, and mothers of child-bearing age about exclusive breastfeeding and its successes and challenges.The community feedback that will be received from these separate groups will be used to improve interventions to ensure the success of exclusive breastfeeding in the district,” she says.She says that to ensure nutritional education and support at antenatal and postnatal clinics in the facilities, nurses are trained to convey the exclusive breastfeeding education to pregnant and nursing mothers during consultation visits, and can walk clients through potential barriers or concerns.‘Marethabile Mothibi, senior PMTCT advisor with the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), says that at health facilities, mothers are always encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their newborn babies for the first six months of life, regardless of their HIV status—which is in line with the national infant and young child feeding guidelines and also embedded in the national guidelines for eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission. Women with HIV continue to take their treatment and have their viral load monitored at the encounter of their pregnancy and every three months thereafter until they are done breastfeeding to ensure they do not pass the virus to their babies.“Apart from being a clinician, I am also a mother of two children, whom have been exclusively breastfed for six months. When I talk to mothers, I also share my living testimony that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable with the support of family members or colleagues. I, therefore, strongly encourage breastfeeding regardless of HIV’s status,” Mothibi says.When I talk to mothers, I also share my living testimony that exclusive breastfeeding is achievable with the support of family members or colleagues.Mothibi says that along with the health benefits of breastfeeding, it is free and it is always warm and ready for the baby at any time, even at night—no need to wake up and prepare it. Breastmilk does not need refrigeration and is always fresh from the source.Another important benefit breastfeeding is that it bonds the mother and her baby. Mothibi says that the bonding extends to the father and the whole family.“At facilities, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are encouraged to bring along their partners or mothers-in-law so that during health education they can also be empowered with information and skills to support nursing mothers during the exclusive breastfeeding period,” she says. Right now, most mothers are opting for breastfeeding because of education provided during antenatal clinics.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scaling Up Nutrition,August 13th 2015,,https://scalingupnutrition.org/news/queen-lesotho-speaks-during-wbw2015-she-continues-her-role-countrys-patron-breastfeeding,"From 1 – 7 August 2015, the World Breastfeeding Week was celebrated in Lesotho which included a launch organised by the Ministry of Health. Lesotho’s Queen, Mamohato Bereng Seeiso, who is also the national patron of breastfeeding, was the guest speaker on the day. Thithidi Diaho, a nutritionist from the Ministry of Health told journalists from Informative News that as part of celebrations that the Queen will tour villages whose inhabitants are factory workers, domestic workers and those employed in the informal sector. “We have seen that there is a gap that needs to be closed in factory workers of mothers who are unable to give their babies enough space and time to breastfeed their babies,” – Thithidi Diaho, Nutritionist, Ministry of Health Central activities of the day included galvanising multi-dimensional support from all sectors to enable women everywhere to work and breastfeed safely and adequately. Speeches promoted employers to become aware that breastfeeding women need to be supported in order to continue breastfeeding their children. The event also informed people about the latest in global Maternity Protection entitlements, and raised awareness of the need to strengthen related national legislation and implementation.Wilfred Nkhoma, a World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Lesotho announced that Lesotho has exceeded the 50% target of exclusive breastfeeding set by all WHO member states during the 2012 World Health Assembly. He said that Lesotho has an estimated exclusive breastfeeding rate of 67% which means Lesotho is among the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have exceeded the 50% target.As part of her role as the country’s Patron of breastfeeding, Lesotho’s Queen has recently appealed to Basotho women to engage in exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months and beyond in a bid to have healthy and well fed babies who are free from diseases.“Exclusive breastfeeding means giving the baby only its mother’s milk without any other supplements” – Mamohato Bereng Seeiso, Queen of LesothoShe appealed to the women that they should shun away from using powdered milk that is sold in shops and to prefer mother’s milk as it is healthy.“Being a patron for breastfeeding in the country, I have visited various districts in the country to sensitise the community about importance of breastfeeding” – Mamohato Bereng Seeiso, Queen of Lesotho Queen Seeiso added that she was proud that Lesotho is doing well in breastfeeding, saying that in 2004, 34% of mothers were breastfeeding their babies while this figure rose in 2009 where 54 % of them (mothers) were breastfeeding their babies and that

PATH,11th September 2008,,https://www.path.org/media-center/infant-and-young-child-nutrition-project-supports-breastfeeding-week-in-lesotho/,"Babies who are properly breastfed can grow up to be healthy and strong like Olympic athletes. That’s the message Queen Masenate Mohato Seeiso of Lesotho delivered to families across the country last month to mark World Breastfeeding Week and its theme, “Mother Support: Going for the Gold.” The queen’s message was backed by the Infant and Young Child Nutrition (IYCN) project, an initiative funded by the US Agency for International Development and led by PATH, with partners CARE, the Manoff Group, and University Research Corporation. The IYCN project aims to improve nutrition for women, infants, and young children. Working with Lesotho’s Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOH/SW), the IYCN project helped the queen convey the importance of breastmilk to close a week-long campaign promoting breastfeeding across the country. “It is very important for people to hear about good breastfeeding practices from Queen Masenate,” said Makatleho Masoabi, Lesotho country coordinator for the IYCN project. “People really listen to what she has to say. After her speech, mothers felt encouraged to breastfeed their babies and they wanted to learn more about good breastfeeding practices.” Improving nutrition, encouraging growth The IYCN project promotes optimal breastfeeding practices—proven methods for reducing malnutrition and enhancing child growth and survival. They include initiating breastfeeding immediately after childbirth, exclusively breastfeeding during the first six months of life, and continuing to breastfeed for at least two years while adding adequate complementary foods into the child’s diet starting at six months old. During World Breastfeeding Week, the IYCN project worked closely with the MOH/SW, breastfeeding advocates, and local groups to help communities learn more about breastfeeding and child nutrition. Project staff helped translate flyers, posters, and other informational materials into Sesotho, the local language, for distribution to mothers at ten hospitals across the country. The team also contacted matrons (nurse midwives) at hospitals to encourage nurses to counsel and support mothers on optimal breastfeeding practices before, during, and after delivery. To reach communities across Lesotho, the IYCN project joined partners in two local radio interviews and answered questions from callers, most of whom wanted to know more about breastfeeding for HIV-positive women. “Many families in Lesotho are unsure about breastfeeding practices for HIV-positive women,” said Masoabi. Exclusive breastfeeding can increase HIV-free survival for infants and young children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHO,6th August 2015,Maseru,https://www.afro.who.int/news/lesotho-commemorates-breastfeeding-week,"Maseru, Lesotho, 6th August 2015 - Hundreds of factory workers and the community gathered to commemorate the National Breastfeeding Week in Maseru on Thursday the 6th of August 2015, under the theme, “Breastfeeding and Work: let’s Make it Work”. The commemoration took place near Thetsane Industrial Area and was targeting the factory workers who normally face many challenges in relation to breastfeeding their children because of the nature of their work. The main speaker in this event was Her Majesty Queen  ‘Masenate Seeiso. She urged not only the government, but the employers and the entire community to support mothers to breastfeed their children for at least six months exclusively. She emphasized that it was the responsibility of everyone to ensure that Lesotho complies with the many global conventions that it is part to. The breastfeeding event was also attended by the Minister of Health Dr. ‘Molotsi Monyamane, the Minister of Employment and Labour and Employment, Advocate Thulo Mahlakeng, the Deputy Minister of Health Ms. Liteboho   Kompi, WHO Country representative Dr. Wilfred Nkhoma, Employees and Workers Representatives and many  other government and health partner representatives.Speaking at this event, the WHO Country Representative, Dr. Wilfred Nkhoma, indicated that successful breastfeeding requires continuous  support to the mothers, not only at home, but in the community and at work. “We urge health care providers, family members and the community at large to continue to support the breastfeeding mothers” He ended his remarks by congratulating all exclusively breastfeeding mothers in Lesotho and calling upon government to ensure supportive legislation and employers to set up breastfeeding and mother friendly workplace environments and conditions of employment.The main commemoration event followed a heart breaking tour by Her Majesty Queen ‘Masenate Seeiso to several Metsoetseng (literaly translated, meaning a places of Breastfeeding Mothers) around the Thetsane Industral Area. These are privately owned day care facilities where mothers leave their children when they go to work in the factories. The ages of children that are cared for in these facilities range from six weeks to about five years. The situation in some of these facilities is very pathetic with poor ventilation, heating and lighting. The hygienic conditions, including sanitation, are also very poor in some of the facilities.During this tour the nursing mothers in the day care facilities had an opportunity to share their experiences and challenges with Her Majesty Queen ‘Masenate Seeiso. These included, but were not limited to, problems posed by the children’s parents, inadequate supplies for the children such as food and nappies and poor health of some of the children they care for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mother to Mothers,6th July 2022,,https://m2m.org/2022/01/06/the-importance-and-benefits-of-exclusive-breastfeeding/,"As we start a new year, we are reflecting on the importance for all children to have the best start in life, and how breastfeeding can help provide this, no matter where you live in the world. There is no question, breastfeeding can be challenging for any mother—from getting baby to latch correctly, to ensuring adequate milk supply, to feeling judged for breastfeeding in public. An ongoing lack of information and outdated perceptions mean mothers living with HIV face additional challenges.   breastfeeding mother and baby Breast milk contains all of the nutrients an infant needs and strengthens their immune system, which is why mothers2mothers (m2m) works so hard to ensure that our clients —both those who are living with HIV and those who are HIV-negative—have all the support they need to breastfeed freely and successfully.   All too often, it’s not common knowledge that women living with HIV can breastfeed safely. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that women living with HIV in resource-poor settings exclusively breastfeed their babies for at least six months, meaning they only receive breast milk. Many women don’t know why exclusive breastfeeding is so critical during this time and how to overcome the challenges they face.  That’s why the work that Mentor Mothers like Maamohelang Nkholise from Lesotho, who is employed by m2m as a frontline health worker, is so important to our clients. We sat down with Maamohelang to ask her some of the most common questions about breastfeeding.  Is exclusive breastfeeding safe for mothers living with HIV?  Yes, breastfeeding is safe for mothers living with HIV. The milk is nutritious and combining exclusive breastfeeding with effective and consistent antiretroviral treatment, means the risk of the mother passing the virus on to her child is extremely low. We teach our clients to get started on treatment and make sure that they take their medication every day. For additional protection, the children are also placed on treatment until they are weaned.  The most important thing we teach our clients is to make sure that they exclusively breastfeed for the first six months. This is because, in those first months, the child’s stomach is still developing, and if the mother gives them anything else than breastmilk, that can cause small tears in the stomach lining, and create space for HIV to enter the child’s blood stream.   After six months, the mother can start introducing solid foods and other drinks, like formula milk. By that time, the risk of passing on the virus is much, much lower.  What challenges do your clients face in relation to exclusive breastfeeding?   The biggest challenge my clients face regarding exclusive breastfeeding is pressure from family. Traditionally, in Lesotho, babies are given traditional medicines and water in the very first days after birth. Many families believe that this is important for the child’s development and protection. This is sometimes difficult for clients to explain to their elders. This why it is so important for Mentor Mothers like us to be working directly with the whole family. In that way, we educate the entire household about safe breastfeeding, and reinforce the information we give to mothers at the clinic.   Fortunately, the families do listen to Mentor Mothers. They know that we live in the same community, and know that their Mentor Mother fully understands their way of life. The fact that they see m2m Mentor Mothers at the clinic, makes us a trusted source for information. How have your clients benefitted from breastfeeding? Many women we serve are unemployed. Buying milk formula is very expensive for them. Breastmilk is free and always available, and it takes some of the financial pressure off families. If the mother has to be away from her baby, she can always express the milk and have someone feed the baby. Most importantly, breastmilk is full of antibodies and nutrients that protect the baby from illnesses. Whenever we explain this to our clients, they get excited and want to start breastfeeding. Can a mother still safely breastfeed if they have COVID-19? A mother can still safely breastfeed if they have tested positive for COVID-19. Fortunately, the breastmilk itself does not contain any traces of COVID-19, and the baby will continue to benefit from the nutrition they get from the breastmilk.* breastfeeding mother while testing Mentor Mothers teach breastfeeding mothers, just like everyone, to always protect themselves from contracting the coronavirus. Whenever they do their follow-up calls or home visits, the Mentor Mother asks them if they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and remind them to get tested as soon as possible if they are showing any symptoms.For Maletsie, one of Maamohelang’s clients, this support has created special moments for her and her little one:  “I got support from the Mentor Mothers at the Nazareth Health Centre on how to exclusively breastfeed, without affecting the health and well-being of my child. I enjoy breastfeeding so much because I get to bond with my baby. My breastmilk is always ready and there is no need to warm it up. What I enjoy the most is how my body has adapted to the needs of my child. What is more amazing is that I am living with HIV, taking my antiretroviral medication, and my baby is HIV-free!” * Pan African Health Organization and WHO recommend that mothers and infants should be supported to remain together, and practice skin-to-skin contact and/or kangaroo care whether or not they or their infants have suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 virus infection.

World \vision,Monday August 21st 2023,,https://www.wvi.org/stories/ghana/nightmare-mothers-breastfeeding-covid-19-pandemic,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Ghana had made significant progress in breastfeeding practices. The country had implemented successful programmes that led to an increase in the adoption and practice of breastfeeding among lactating mothers across the country. Almost all children (98%) were breastfed at some point in their lives, according to the Ghana Demographic Health Survey (DHS) Report 2014. Among them, 52% of less than six months were exclusively breastfed, and the median duration of exclusive breastfeeding recorded at the time was about four months. The report indicated that micronutrient malnutrition was highly prevalent and persistent. 66 percent of children aged 6-59 months were anaemic, 27 percent were mildly anaemic, 37 %, moderately anaemic, and about 2 % were severely anaemic.However, the COVID-19 pandemic has put breastfeeding progress at risk and may worsen the prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition, which was already high. The pandemic affected not only the health system but also breastfeeding practises and women's access to breastfeeding support services. This created a breastfeeding gap that needs to be filled. For example, mothers who were suspected or confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 avoided or stopped breastfeeding their babies to avoid infecting them with the virus.During the COVID-19 period, a decrease in the number of mothers breastfeeding their babies and a rise in the number of mothers using baby formula foods were highly expected. COVID-19 affected breastfeeding and appropriate supplementary feeding practises and denied babies sufficient intake of micro and macronutrients essential for growth and development.Breast milk prevents repeated episodes of infection in children and helps with brain development and growth. Breast milk also protects babies from morbidity and mortality throughout infancy and childhood. It is highly encouraged to initiate breastfeeding at birth because of its importance to both the mother and the child.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that children be fed with colostrum immediately after birth (within one hour) and that they continue to be breastfed exclusively, even if regular breast milk has not yet started to flow properly.  Access to breastfeeding services at birth is essential to stimulate breast milk production. Early suckling stimulates the release of prolactin, a hormone that helps with milk production, and oxytocin, which is responsible for the ejection of milk. It also stimulates the contraction of the uterus after birth and reduces postpartum blood loss. The first milk, called colostrum, is produced in the first few days after delivery. It is highly nutritious and contains antibodies that provide natural immunity to the infant.However, some lactating mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 had challenges maintaining exclusive breastfeeding for children under six months or continuing breastfeeding for infants. This created a breastfeeding gap. World Vision Ghana addressed this gap by implementing the Improved Feeding Practices (IFP) for the First 1000 Days project. The project introduced multiple approaches to promote exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding practises in 70 rural communities in Kintampo South, Sekyere East, and Kassena Nankana West districts in Ghana, where malnutrition, stunting, and anaemia cases were prevalent. The project also involved men as key partners in nutrition and child healthcare, supporting farmers to grow nutritious fruit crops and vegetables such as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and poultry rearing to increase the consumption of fresh eggs.World Vision Ghana worked closely with the Ghana Health Services, Department of Agriculture, Social Welfare, and community structures to sustain the project initiatives throughout their lifespan. Aside from this, the project also built the capacity of mother-to-mother support groups, male champions (men promoting child health, nutrition, and breastfeeding) to continue child healthcare, nutrition, and breastfeeding campaigns, and village entrepreneurs for the sale and distribution of food supplements such as Koko Plus.Aside from encouraging mothers confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of COVID-19 infection to continually breastfeed babies, they were also trained to practise respiratory hygiene during feeding and to use a medical mask, as well as regularly wash hands with soap under running water, apply hand sanitizer, routinely clean surfaces, and observe hygiene protocols.As a result of this, 85% of mothers in the project communities have adopted and practiced exclusive breastfeeding. Also, 3,960 mothers who received training in the importance and effectiveness of breast milk, breastfeeding, and child healthcare and nutrition practices have begun to provide support to new mothers.The project has so far reached 11,000 people directly with child health and nutrition messages.

Solidar Med ,"22nd December, 2020",,https://www.solidarmed.ch/en/news/non-communicable-diseases-lesotho-combacal,"Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, high blood pressure and impaired mental health are the number one cause of death and disability globally. More than 75% of all premature NCD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. A consortium of implementation partners and researchers led by SolidarMed proposes a multi-disciplinary research for development program fighting this disproportionate health and socio-economic burden. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) will fund the program with 6 Mio CHF over the next five years. Lesotho, similar to other sub-Saharan countries, faces a situation where the health burden of NCDs now overtakes HIV and other infectious diseases. The country has successfully managed to reduce HIV transmission and AIDS-related deaths due to a decentralized HIV testing and care strategy. A key attribute of this strategy is the involvement of community health workers (CHW) to guarantee access of testing and treatment to the rural population. The awarded program aims at applying similar approaches in the fight against NCDs. The program called ComBaCaL (Community Based chronic disease Care Lesotho) has been jointly developed by a consortium led by the Swiss NGO SolidarMed together with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH), the National University of Lesotho, the Lesotho Ministry of Health, and an affected community member. Further collaborators include the University of Zurich (Department of Informatics) and an eHealth start-up from Lesotho. Both, HIV and NCDs are chronic diseases and require life-long treatment. ComBaCaL will build upon the lessons learnt from the decentralized HIV program. The program aims at improving NCD care at 23 health facilities through structured staff trainings and supervision, as well as at community level through CHW who will be trained and empowered to deliver NCD prevention, screening, diagnosis - and even care. A locally developed eHealth application will support the trainings, supervision and care provision at community and facility level and efficiently link the data. “In the spirit of SDG 17 we aim to tackle the growing NCD pandemic through a multi-disciplinary South-North research for implementation partnership,” states Niklaus Labhardt, Research Group Leader at Swiss TPH and president of SolidarMed. His team of researchers, together with the local SolidarMed Lesotho team, has successfully validated and implemented several innovative community-based HIV test-and-treat models in Lesotho over the last 5 years (more information here). In a large-scale cluster randomized trial, they will evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth supported community-based care within ComBaCaL. “This trial will allow to assess if eHealth supported CHW could be a feasible, safe and effective approach to increase access to NCD care for communities living in remote areas,” says Alain Amstutz. Improving not only health, but also social and economic well-being of communities
Poverty and social factors are closely linked to NCDs. The rise of these chronic diseases in turn impede poverty reduction in low- and middle-income countries. By offering innovative and high-quality NCD care close to people’s home, ComBaCaL will directly address this problem. Moreover, ComBaCaL aims to bring more holistic and structural change to the communities involved: The CHWs, mostly women, will be employed by a social enterprise, where they acquire entrepreneurial skills enabling them to set up small enterprises (e.g., trading goods) to earn a living. Thus, this initiative is driven by a health equity spirit, will strengthen rural communities, and create self-sustainable jobs. “I believe that ComBaCaL will have a transformative impact on NCD care in developing countries in an innovative self-sustainable way,” says Ilse van Roy, Head of International Programs at SolidarMed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BMC Reproductive \health,23rd January 2020,,https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-020-0857-8,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region is a home for over one billion population distributed in 46 different countries. Over the decades, this region has confronted with high disease burden accounting around 24% of the global disease burden [1]. Traditionally, communicable diseases such as HIV, TB, and Malaria have long been the most prominent contributors to the disease burden. However, in the last two decades, the region has witnessed an epidemiological transition to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [2]. Around 80% of all NCDs deaths occur in low and middle-income countries. It is projected that by 2020, NCDs will account for 27% of mortality in SSA [3]. Majority of NCDs related deaths can be prevented by addressing the common modifiable risk factors for NCDs include tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, and unhealthy diet [4]. The NCDs and reproductive health morbidity and mortality, has become a significant part of the disease burden in the region requiring a rethink on policy prioritisation and implementation to minimise the burden. The WHO defines reproductive health as a “state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes.” This implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they can reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so [5]. However, reproductive health among women was often constrained by socio-cultural and economic factors across the societies, particularly in SSA. The access to abortion and contraception are severely restricted, contributing to high maternal mortalities and poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes [6,7,8,9]. Reproductive and maternal morbidities increase the risk of maternal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal death. Women facing pregnancy related complications are predisposed to immediate and long-term disabilities and infertility as well as adverse psychological and socio-economic consequences. SSA region faces high burden of maternal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates [10]. In 2015, two-thirds of all maternal deaths worldwide occurred in SSA (546 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births [11]. SSA women in reproductive age (15–49 years) have low contraceptive prevalence rate (28%), and about half of them do not receive four or more antenatal check-ups (54%), and do not give birth in health facilities (52%). Further, adolescent girls and young women in the region face high risk of unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and exposure to violence [12]. Further, 244,000 infants in the region annually become infected with HIV during pregnancy and delivery (115,000) or breast-feeding (129,000) [13]. The unmet needs of sexual and reproductive health services among SSA women are coupled with the rising burden of non-communicable diseases. NCDs account for almost 65% of women’s deaths globally, and the majority of these deaths occur in LMICs and are premature. In recent years, NCDs among women of reproductive age has doubled in many African countries [14]. Also, there are established linkages between NCDs and reproductive health. Several NCDs risk factors adversely affect the reproductive health of women. For example, obesity, CVDs, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and gestational diabetes predispose pregnant women at higher risk of menstrual problems, hypertension in pregnancy, caesarean sections, post-natal complications and maternal mortality [10]. Obesity also increases the odds of developing CVDs and cancers in women [15, 16]. In a recent study, the prevalence of obesity across 32 Sub-Saharan African countries ranged from 1.1% in Madagascar to 23.0% in Swaziland [17]. A study shows that that women at the beginning of pregnancy 73.7% and 60.2% women in South Africa and Zimbabwe, respectively started their pregnancy with BMI above normal (BMI ≥ 25) [18]. 
Epidemiological, clinical and animal studies have shown the modelling effect of fetal life on NCDs diseases of adult life, like hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes [19]. Furthermore, nutrients restriction during fetal life have shown higher blood pressure in the progeny. Animal studies have shown that protein restriction and calcium restriction during pregnancy involved hypertension of the progeny [20]. In humans, calcium supplementation during pregnancy involved a reduction of hypertension of children whose mothers were supplemented in comparison with a placebo group [21]. In a previous mentioned study done in South Africa and Zimbabwe the prevalence of inadequate micronutrient intake from food sources was high in both countries. For the most basic micronutrients like iron, calcium, folate and zinc, the percentage of women below requirements was above 90% in both countries [18]. Further, research suggests that obesity is linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women. Moreover, obese women with PCOS have worse metabolic and reproductive outcomes [22]. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is one of the major cause of maternal deaths and stillbirths in the region [10]. African Union (AU) is at the forefront of shaping the national health priorities including women and child health. The AU, despite being the first to develop African Charter of Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa that mandates state provision of comprehensive reproductive and sexual health services, is yet to be a reality and achieve the objective [23]. Building on Millennium Development Goal’s (MDGs) progress on reducing maternal and child mortality and malnutrition, combating infectious diseases, an updated Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health (2016–2030) was launched in 2016 [24, 25]. This universal and equity-based strategy aims to end preventable deaths among women by reducing global maternal mortality to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and reduce by one-third premature mortality from NCDs and promote mental health and well-being. The reproductive health policies must be in alignment with this global strategy to minimize the mortalities due to NCDs risk factors linked to reproductive health. And also, to optimize better sexual and reproductive health in the SSA. At the individual level, prevention and continuum of care approach through “life-course” are essential for the prevention of NCDs. While most NCD related health outcomes cause morbidity and mortality during adulthood, exposure to risk factors begins early in life, and these behaviours often get established for the lifetime. WHO recommends that NCD prevention and control measures to consider health and social needs and reduce exposure to risk factors at all stages of the life course. Similarly, improving reproductive health outcomes calls for a comprehensive understanding of women’s health throughout the life course. The global strategy for women’s health adopts an integrated life course approach and underscores the need for investment in child and adolescent health and development [24]. At the systemic level, a comprehensive approach requires multipronged strategies focussing on prevention within primary care through community-based programs, health promotion, and cost-effective policies that target the whole population as well as high-risk individuals. Both NCDs and reproductive health thus needs to be addressed through both “population-based” and “high-risk individual” based approaches to empower individuals and populations to make healthier choices and access to health services. The global strategy recommends integrating NCDs prevention and treatment with women’s, children’s, and adolescents’ health care [24, 25]. The population-level approaches include increasing awareness, creating a conducive environment and instituting public health policies while high-risk individual-level approaches include early diagnosis and management and treatment of disease and need to integrate into the health systems in SSA. At the policy level, various bodies have emphasised the need for a collective response towards addressing health issues as it cuts across the sectors. The WHO has emphasized that effective NCD prevention and control require “health-in-all policies and whole-of-government approaches” across sectors, involving a range of ministries outside health such as health, agriculture, communication, education, employment, social welfare, social and economic development, sports, trade and industry transport, urban planning and others. Similarly, Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health also emphasise the adoption of a multi-sectoral approach to develop and monitor interventions outside the health sector and asserts the countries to build governance mechanisms and capacity to facilitate multisector actor and cross-sector collaborations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WHO,"1 February, 2013",,https://www.afro.who.int/news/launching-national-cervical-cancer-screening-program-lesotho,"The Kingdom of Lesotho launched its National Cervical Cancer Screening Program on the 30th January 2013 at Sankatana Centre of Excellence in Maseru, with the assistance of the American People, through funding from the United States for International Development (USAID), and in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and EGPAF. The inauguration also celebrated a very important day which is celebrated every year on the 04th February, World Cancer Day, under the theme of “Know the fact about Cancer”. The event was launched by the Honorable Minister of Health, Dr Pinkie Rosemary Manamolela.  In her statement, Dr. Manamolela, indicated that Lesotho now faces a huge burden of non- communicable diseases, of which cervical cancer forms a significant part. It is estimated that cervical cancer is responsible for 4% of the mortality rate amongst women in the country. There are approximately 35 new cases per 100 000 of females being diagnosed with cervical cancer in Lesotho per year. The screening program at Sankatana Centre will have huge benefits for Lesotho. “The centre will help Lesotho to save about 9000 US$ the Government uses to treat each cancer patient in South Africa and will also help to establish sustainable prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer through the implementation of evidence based strategies for early detection and treatment” said Dr. Pinkie Manamolela. She urged all to put heads and hands together to tackle the challenges head-on and indicated that the Ministry of Health will continue to emphasize information dissemination to the community and mobilize support from development partners to ensure that everybody is reached with one message.  In his remarks, Mr. Charles Lyons, the CEO and President in EGPAF, indicated that early diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer helps to save lives of women and preserve the gains we have made in HIV. He indicated that working towards the goal of an HIV-free generations will combat all HIV and AIDS related disease to keep family well and healthy. He emphasized that EGPAF developed the Centre with the purpose of providing human resource support, building park homes where services and training will take place, proving medical equipment and supplies and establishing an electronic medical record keeping system. Speaking at the same occasion, the WHO Representative to Lesotho, Dr. Jacob Mufunda, emphasized that the comprehensive approach to cancer control encompasses all the steps from primary prevention with vaccines and secondary prevention, that is screening for and management of precancerous lesions, to treatment and palliative care with radiotherapy, within the context of continuum of care. Dr. Mufunda pointed out that since cancers affect children, families and the community, there is a dire need to act to reduce morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer. Dr. Mufunda concluded that the WHO in Africa region is advocating for a comprehensive approach to cancer prevention and control that encompasses prevention, screening, management of precancer-ous lesions and treatment and proper palliative care using radiotherapy, a programme in the pipeline with support from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The U.S. Charge d’ Affaires, David J. McCrane, stressed that there is a need for a national scale up of cervical cancer screening in women living with HIV, and women in the reproductive age group as cervical cancer still remains the leading cause of cancer related mortality in HIV infected Basotho women. He indicated that the rate of cervical cancer and HIV will be reduced significantly by 2015 when combined with the laudable national rollout of the human papillomavirus vaccine program by the Government of Lesotho.  Mr McCrane promised to continue to collaborate with the Government of Lesotho and private sector partners in establishing programs to build the capacity of healthcare managers and workers to provide HIV services. The center, with continued support from the United States government over the next two years, through the strengthening Clinical services project, will also train local Basotho healthcare workers to provide these services. He concluded that the United States government is proud to support this innovative approach as it embodies the concepts of country ownership, local capacity building strategic investments.

Fronteers,9th June 2020,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00866/full,"Herbal medicine use has grown considerably worldwide among pregnant women, and is particularly widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. However, herbal medicines used across sub-Saharan Africa are associated with important research gaps and a lack of regulatory framework. This is particularly problematic, as herbal medicine use during pregnancy raises several concerns attributed to the herbal ingredient itself, conventional drug-herbal medicine interactions, and contamination or adulteration of herbal remedies. Moreover, several local herbal remedies used by sub-Saharan African pregnant women have never been botanically identified. In this review, an overview of the practice of herbal medicine, including the regulations, challenges and overall safety, is provided. Then, we discuss the prevalence of herbal medicine use during pregnancy across different sub-Saharan African countries, as well as the indications, adverse outcomes, and effectiveness of the most commonly used herbal medicines during pregnancy in that region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,5th July 2013 ,,https://www.pih.org/article/lesotho-maternal-mortality-clinics,"Lesotho is among the most dangerous countries for pregnant women. From conception to delivery, daunting terrain, sparse medical facilities, and cultural barriers make it difficult to access proper health care. In the Mountain Kingdom, for every 100,000 live births, 1,155 women die from pregnancy-related complications, giving Lesotho one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world, according to recent estimates from Measure DHS, a USAID-funded  project that collects health data in 90 countries. But Malineo Sethobane is helping change that. The 50-year-old mother of five began working for Partners In Health/Lesotho in 2010 as a maternal health worker (MHW) in the village of Lipeneng. Because she’s from the community she serves, Sethobane is uniquely situated to connect with women early in their pregnancy. She accompanies them over the following months to make sure they get antenatal care and deliver their children in a safe environment with trained medical staff at the ready.In 2009, PIH/L piloted its Maternal Mortality Reduction Program (MMRP) in the village of Bobete. “I remember when we started the pilot in Bobete, we wondered ‘why aren’t women coming in for antenatal care?’ We were told it was cultural. The assumption was that women don’t want to come to a facility,” recalled Dr. Hind Satti, Lesotho country director for PIH.It didn’t take long for the program to engender a drastic shift in how pregnant women seek and obtain health care. The year before the MMRP launched at Bobete Health Center, only 46 women delivered at the facility. In the second year of the program, 216 women delivered at Bobete Health Center.In the years that followed, PIH/L bolstered its efforts in Bobete, and then expanded to seven other sites.“Now it’s very acceptable for women to come to give birth in the facilities,” said Satti. “The main reason: we put in good infrastructure, we treat them with dignity, and we provide high-quality services. There had been a lack of trust … it wasn’t because women didn’t want to come.”Earning that trust wasn’t easy. At every step of the way, Satti and her team were devising sustainable solutions to deeply ingrained problems. They met with village chiefs to build consensus that women shouldn't die while giving birth. From there, they recruited men and women and traditional birth assistants—trusted in the community, but in need of formal training—to work as MHWs. Every MHW passes through a rigorous training program tailored specifically for Lesotho. Nohana Clinic Site Director Meriam Sesiu Kopeli holds a healthy baby boy. The mother was accompanied to the clinic by PIH/L maternal health worker Malineo Sethobane. Photo: Rebecca E. Rollins/Partners In Health To overcome transportation difficulties (imagine walking hours through steep mountain paths at night; now imagine doing it while in labor), PIH/L and community members built maternal waiting houses at each clinic. A few weeks before a patient's due date, she’s accompanied by her MWH to one of these waiting houses.  Once there, the patient can relax for the remainder of her pregnancy, knowing that she’s only a few yards from trained medical professionals. Sethobane and the hundreds of other MHWs are the backbone of PIH/L’s MMRP.  They form an essential link between the community and the health center, referring patients for care as needed and making sure the health centers respond  to the community’s needs. At Bobete, where the program launched, the number of facility-based deliveries has increased 370 percent since 2009. On average, MHWs are assigned 75 women. They go door-to-door each month, meeting with every client. If a woman suspects she might be pregnant, the MHW arranges a trip to the clinic for a pregnancy test. The earlier a pregnancy is confirmed, the more effective antenatal care is. MHWs are also trained to educate their communities on HIV testing and family planning. “MMRP is an intervention that empowers women in rural areas. We’re encouraging them to be productive members of society—not to sit back,” Satti says. “Addressing maternal mortality is a gate for us to address all aspects of women’s health—empowering women, which impacts their children’s and families’ health.” Two mothers and their infants waiting at Bobete Clinic for postnatal appointments. Photo: Rebecca E. Rollins/Partners In Health Not only is the program empowering, it’s extraordinarily effective. Last year, more than 1,500 women delivered babies in a health care setting. PIH/L recorded more than 4,500 prenatal care visits, and conducted more than 1,700 HIV tests. At Bobete, where the program launched, the number of facility-based deliveries has increased 370 percent since 2009. In the few years Sethobane has been working as an MHW, she’s accompanied more than 11 mothers from the village to the health center and made hundreds of home visits. She says she’s learned that commitment to the individual patient is vital, and that simple steps can improve the health of an entire family. Despite these gains, Lesotho remains a challenging environment to give birth. Satti is confident, however, that the country is heading in the right direction. “We are not going to accept any maternal deaths. It takes commitment and teamwork to make this happen. We all started with that spirit—that there is no reason a woman should die during pregnancy or giving birth,” she says. “Midwives, drivers all share that spirit. Everybody is ready.” ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UNFPA,24th February 2023,,https://lesotho.unfpa.org/en/news/woman-dies-every-two-minutes-due-pregnancy-or-childbirth-un-agencies-3,"Every two minutes, a woman dies during pregnancy or childbirth, according to the latest estimates released in a report by United Nations agencies today. This report, Trends in maternal mortality, reveals alarming setbacks for women’s health over recent years, as maternal deaths either increased or stagnated in nearly all regions of the world. “While pregnancy should be a time of immense hope and a positive experience for all women, it is tragically still a shockingly dangerous experience for millions around the world who lack access to high quality, respectful health care,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO). “These new statistics reveal the urgent need to ensure every woman and girl has access to critical health services before, during and after childbirth, and that they can fully exercise their reproductive rights.” The report, which tracks maternal deaths nationally, regionally and globally from 2000 to 2020, shows there were an estimated 287 000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2020. This marks only a slight decrease from 309 000 in 2016 when the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came into effect. While the report presents some significant progress in reducing maternal deaths between 2000 and 2015, gains largely stalled, or in some cases even reversed, after 2015. 
In two of the eight UN regions – Europe and Northern America, and Latin America and the Caribbean – the maternal mortality rate increased from 2016 to 2020, by 17% and 15% respectively. Elsewhere, the rate stagnated. The report notes, however, that progress is possible. For example, two regions – Australia and New Zealand, and Central and Southern Asia – experienced significant declines (by 35% and 16% respectively) in their maternal mortality rates during the same period, as did 31 countries across the world.“For millions of families, the miracle of childbirth is marred by the tragedy of maternal deaths,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “No mother should have to fear for her life while bringing a baby into the world, especially when the knowledge and tools to treat common complications exist. Equity in healthcare gives every mother, no matter who they are or where they are, a fair chance at a safe delivery and a healthy future with their family.”In total numbers, maternal deaths continue to be largely concentrated in the poorest parts of the world and in countries affected by conflict. In 2020, about 70% of all maternal deaths were in sub-Saharan Africa. In nine countries facing severe humanitarian crises, maternal mortality rates were more than double the world average (551 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, compared to 223 globally).“This report provides yet another stark reminder of the urgent need to double down on our commitment to women and adolescent health,” said Juan Pablo Uribe, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank, and Director of the Global Financing Facility. “With immediate action, more investments in primary health care and stronger, more resilient health systems, we can save lives, improve health and well-being, and advance the rights of and opportunities for women and adolescents.” Severe bleeding, high blood pressure, pregnancy-related infections, complications from unsafe abortion, and underlying conditions that can be aggravated by pregnancy (such as HIV/AIDS and malaria) are the leading causes of maternal deaths. These are all largely preventable and treatable with access to high-quality and respectful healthcare. Community-centered primary health care can meet the needs of women, children and adolescents and enable equitable access to critical services such as assisted births and pre- and postnatal care, childhood vaccinations, nutrition and family planning. However, underfunding of primary health care systems, a lack of trained health care workers, and weak supply chains for medical products are threatening progress. Roughly a third of women do not have even four of a recommended eight antenatal checks or receive essential postnatal care, while some 270 million women lack access to modern family planning methods. Exercising control over their reproductive health – particularly decisions about if and when to have children – is critical to ensure that women can plan and space childbearing and protect their health. Inequities related to income, education, race or ethnicity further increase risks for marginalized pregnant women, who have the least access to essential maternity care but are most likely to experience underlying health problems in pregnancy.""It is unacceptable that so many women continue to die needlessly in pregnancy and childbirth. Over 280,000 fatalities in a single year is unconscionable,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “We can and must do better by urgently investing in family planning and filling the global shortage of 900,000 midwives so that every woman can get the lifesaving care she needs. We have the tools, knowledge and resources to end preventable maternal deaths; what we need now is the political will.""The COVID-19 pandemic may have further held back progress on maternal health. Noting the current data series ends in 2020, more data will be needed to show the true impacts of the pandemic on maternal deaths. However, COVID-19 infections can increase risks during pregnancy, so countries should take action to ensure pregnant women and those planning pregnancies have access to COVID-19 vaccines and effective antenatal care.""Reducing maternal mortality remains one of the most pressing global health challenges,” said John Wilmoth, Director of the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “Ending preventable maternal deaths and providing universal access to quality maternal health care require sustained national and international efforts and unwavering commitments, particularly for the most vulnerable populations.  It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every mother, everywhere, survives childbirth, so that she and her children can thrive."" The report reveals that the world must significantly accelerate progress to meet global targets for reducing maternal deaths, or else risk the lives of over 1 million more women by 2030.About the report The report was produced by WHO on behalf of the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group and the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. It uses national data to estimate levels and trends of maternal mortality from 2000-2020. The data in this new publication supersede all previous estimates published by WHO and the United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medicines Sans Frontireers ,3rd November 2015,,https://www.msf.org/lesotho-free-maternal-care-has-impressive-return-investment,"JOHANNESBURG/MASERU – The introduction of free deliveries at a hospital in Lesotho, the country with one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world, drastically reduced maternal deaths during labour and delivery, making the intervention a cheap and highly effective public health measure, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on Tuesday. The number of women giving birth in the Roma hospital increased by 45 per cent within a year after MSF offered to cover all their expenses. This shows that fees are a huge barrier in preventing women from seeking medical help for delivery in a country where up to 40 per cent of women give birth at home without the help of a skilled attendant. “Giving life shouldn’t cost a life. But in Lesotho, delivering a baby has either a financial cost for the mother, or a dramatically high human cost for the society. Free maternal health care at both health centre and hospital level is a simple and relatively cheap measure with a huge return on investment in terms of public health”, says Dr Amir Shroufi, MSF deputy medical coordinator for South Africa and Lesotho. According to the World Bank Lesotho has one of the highest maternal mortality rate in the world with estimates ranging anywhere from 600 to 1,200 deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal death in Lesotho is frequently due to complications around delivery that can be handled at hospital level: 34% due to sepsis, 20% due to post-abortion complication, 14% due to obstructed or prolonged labour and 12% due to eclampsia. Hospital fees for delivery cost as little as $10 per birth for each woman, but this fee can represent up to a month’s salary for rural people in Lesotho. The introduction of free maternal care in the country would only amount to a tiny fraction (less than 1 per cent) of health spend per capita according to MSF calculations. “This strategy shows that removing out of pocket fees for hospital delivery has a very high return on investment. We call on the government of Lesotho to make delivery free also at hospital level for mothers-to-be across the country, and in doing so help ensure that fewer women and infants die around the time of pregnancy”, says Jesper Hildebrandt Brix, MSF’s project coordinator in Lesotho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Then they try to fix it."" Performing ""maternal death audits"" and other non-medical postnatal care activities, such as home visits by community health workers, during the first seven days after the birth of an infant is saving the lives of newborns and mothers in developing countries, he told IRIN at the release of the annual report of UNICEF, the UN Children's Agency. Saving mothers is critical. Babies whose mothers die in the first six weeks of their lives are far more likely to die in the first two years of life than those whose mothers survive, the report said. A study in Afghanistan found that about three-quarters of infants born to mothers who died, also subsequently died. Other developing countries have begun to adopt these measures and best practices to bring down the number of newborn and maternal deaths. Postnatal care is a major gap in almost all such countries and is the time of most newborn and maternal deaths, said Joy Lawn, senior research and policy advisor with Save the Children-US, who contributed to the UNICEF report. She said data from Bangladesh showed that a home visit on the first and or second day after birth could reduce neonatal deaths by two-thirds. The first seven days of life was also ""the critical period for initiating high-impact life-saving behaviours, including exclusive breastfeeding."" Merely getting babies on to exclusive breastfeeding immediately could save the lives of 30 percent of newborns Shiferaw said. The figures Nearly four million newborns die every year – three quarters of these deaths take place within one week of birth, and one to two million babies die during the first day after birth, according Lawn. Simple measures like exclusive breastfeeding and keeping the baby warm could save almost half those lives. At least half a million women die every year as a result of pregnancy or childbirth complications. ""More than 99 percent of these deaths occurred in developing countries – the vast majority in Africa and Asia,"" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. ""On average, each day around 1,500 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth."" The average lifetime risk of a woman in a least-developed country dying from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth is more than 300 times greater than for a woman living in an industrialised country, according to UNICEF. No other mortality rate is so unequal.  Around 70,000 of these deaths are among girls and young women aged 15 to 19. Around 99 percent of maternal deaths take place in the developing world, where having a child is still among the most serious health risks to women. At least 21 percent of maternal deaths take place in just three countries: Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Nigeria. In Niger, West Africa, which has the highest lifetime risk of maternal mortality worldwide, 1 in 7 women die from complications related to pregnancy or giving birth. Fixing it A significant portion of the deaths result from bleeding after delivery, and these lives could also be saved simply by a community member checking up on the mother, said experts. ""In most cases, women are discharged after delivery - no one follows up the woman to her home to see if she is okay,"" said Lawn. ""For babies and mothers facing such complications as neonatal sepsis or postpartum haemorrhage, delay of even a few hours before appropriate care is delivered can be fatal, or result in long-term injuries or disability."" The community health worker in Malawi follows up on the mother before and after a delivery, and is in constant touch with the clinic should complications develop. ""It's just a matter of good management of scarce resources and innovation,"" said Lawn. Ethiopia, a drought-stricken country in the Horn of Africa with one of the highest maternal death rates in the world, now also trains community health workers. It still has a long way to go, as only six percent of births are attended by skilled healthcare workers, according to Veneman. Kenya and India offer cash incentives to mothers to attend antenatal clinics, while UNICEF assisted in training community workers in Malawi, who are now on the government's payroll. Lawn said investment in midwife training was required, especially in countries with low health coverage and facility care at birth. But Shiferaw argued that if countries could not afford health workers, they could provide basic training to family or ordinary community members. ""Just simple tips like wrapping the baby up as soon as it is born, and clearing the nostril to ensure it's breathing, does not require a great amount of investment."" Another health expert attending the launch of UNICEF's report commented that it was just a matter of political will. Sri Lanka Developing countries do not have far to look. Prioritising investment in postnatal care has achieved dramatic results in Sri Lanka, where an ongoing civil war is being fought, said Shiferaw. The country scaled up health services for mothers and infants and has managed to halve its maternal mortality rate every six to 11 years by adopting sound strategies, allocating sufficient resources, and making a political commitment to improving the health of mothers and children. More than 98 percent of births in Sri Lanka take place in hospitals with a skilled nurse, midwife or doctor in attendance, and 99 percent of pregnant women make use of antenatal care services. The successes are not the result of medical interventions alone; efforts to empower women through education and employment have also played a significant role in lowering maternal and newborn death rates, according to UNICEF. Other countries have begun to take notice. Between 1995 and 2005, skilled birth attendant coverage increased from 54 percent to 62 percent in the developing world, while antenatal care rose from 60 percent to 75 percent, said Veneman. 
""Yet, around 50 million births in the developing world, or about 40 percent of all births, remain without skilled health personnel.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

International Labour Organization ,,,https://www.ilo.org/africa/hundred/WCMS_684307/lang--en/index.htm,"MASERU – When 31-year-old Mamontseng Habahaba was pregnant with her third child, the quality control inspector at one of Lesotho’s 39 garment factories did not bother telling her supervisor. She figured she would just work until it was time to give birth, unaware of her rights as a pregnant factory worker. Into her second and third trimester, she struggled to stay on her feet for her nine-hour daytime shift, and though her pregnancy eventually became obvious, she was not provided a chair to sit on, nor did she dare to ask for one. “This is something that cannot be done in this factory,” Habahaba said. “If your work requires you to work standing, you have to work standing, even when you are pregnant.’’ Habahaba requested maternity leave when she was seven months pregnant, and she took her leave at the last possible moment, on 15 January 2014. Four days later, she gave birth prematurely to Molise Habahaba, a 3.6 kg baby boy named after his grandfather. Seven years earlier, Mamontseng Habahaba had quit her job at the same factory, unable to afford a nanny when she gave birth to her first child. This time, the family’s financial strain sent her back to work two months after Molise was born. Unaware of her maternity rights What Habahaba knew from her supervisor and other colleagues at the factory was that she was allowed 12 weeks leave. What she did not yet know was that a law amended in October 2013 requires paid leave for six of those 12 weeks. When Habahaba returned to work, she was only given two weeks’ pay to cover the time she took off. What’s more, with an extra mouth to feed, she also began working overtime even though labour laws prohibit nursing mothers from taking extra hours. Habahaba said she did not know she was not supposed to work overtime. And only recently was she aware of the amended law on paid maternity leave. “We only knew some time ago and we lodged a complaint to our shop stewards and they are working on the issue,” Habahaba said. “However, the workers that came back from maternity leave after we lodged the complaint have been paid six weeks.’’ Promoting maternity benefits and rights “Habahaba’s situation repeats itself at other apparel factories where pregnant workers face losing out on benefits entitled to them and rights that protect them in the workplace before and after giving birth,” says Kristina Kurths, from Better Work Lesotho, a partnership programme from the ILO and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The project helps protect pregnant workers by offering maternity protection training as part of its Workers’ Life Skills Programme. Under this new initiative, human resource managers of factories are trained to understand and observe the law, and also train peer educators who in turn instructing their co-workers on maternity health issues. Drilling deeper into the issue, the Programme conducted a series of Workers Focus Group discussions with workers from 17 factories to help Better Work and the factories it works with better understand the unique needs of pregnant workers. Habahaba stayed with her baby for two months, though is now feeling the pinch of lost income. Better protection “Factory improvements, such as a subsidised nursery on site, would help reduce the financial burden for working mothers of newborns,” Habahaba says.
Better Work Lesotho therefore plans to deepen its work at the factory level among managers and workers so that employees like Habahaba are being better protected. Progress has already been made: as of late 2013, workers in a factory for one year or more are now entitled six weeks of paid maternity leave. “Maternity protection in the apparel industry workplace has been a long neglected topic. We are working together with our partners – unions, employers and the government to strengthen the law and promote compliance with it. The Programme is a first step to creating decent work in Lesotho’s key industry which is part of the global garment supply chain,” concludes Kurths.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UNFPA,5th November 2021,QUTHING,https://esaro.unfpa.org/en/news/early-and-unintended-pregnancies-rife-lesotho-13-year-olds-among-those-bearing-children,"QUTHING, Lesotho—More teenage girls are admitted to the maternity ward of Quthing government hospital than women of childbearing age.“We see them mostly because we admit them at the waiting mothers’ shelters,” says Ntebaleng Stoffel, a nurse midwife on the ward. “Since they are prone to risk, they have to deliver at hospital, not any other health facility.” Lineo Mabusa, a nurse midwife in the hospital's antenatal clinic, confirms that 87 per cent of those who seek antenatal care services at the clinic are teenagers aged between 13 and 19. Teenage pregnancy remains a challenge in Lesotho. The adolescent birth rate is high, at 94 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 (2003-2018). A 2017 report by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) listed Lesotho among the leading countries on early and unintended pregnancies. Six out of 10 girls (60 per cent) aged 15 to 19 are mothers or pregnant with their first child, which places Lesotho second to Namibia (seven out of 10 girls) for high rates of unintended pregnancies among the East and Southern African countries, the report stated.  Because their bodies are not yet fully developed, pregnant adolescent girls are at greater risk of complications such as cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), which leads to difficulties in the unborn baby descending. This usually means a Caesarean section is necessary, explains Ms. Stoffel. Often, pregnant teenagers are not able to follow birthing instructions due to lowered understanding, she says. For example, a young mother may start pushing the baby out before their cervix is sufficiently dilated, causing a cervical tear. Unfortunately, pregnant teenagers do not always seek adequate antenatal care services due to the challenges and stigma that they face, says Ms. Mabusa. “Most of them come late for ANC [services] because they are afraid of coming without informing [their] parents. Sometimes they do not have transport to the facility, or they are afraid of their peers knowing that they are pregnant,” she says. Some adolescent girls hide their pregnancies because they do not want to miss any classes at school. “Most of them have pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), which is rife among the teenagers. Others end up with miscarriages mainly due to excessive stress, often caused by embarrassment and fear,” Ms. Mabusa says. Health risks for young mothers and babies Early childbearing is associated with health risks for both mother and child. Teenage mothers are more likely to experience pregnancy-related complications that lead to maternal death. In Lesotho, the maternal mortality ratio is high, at 618 deaths per 100,000 live births (Census 2016). Studies have shown that women in Lesotho mostly die of obstetric haemorrhage (33 per cent), hypertension-related conditions (24 per cent) and puerperal sepsis (6 per cent). Out of concern for the high rate of maternal deaths, UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, supports the Government of Lesotho’s efforts to increase access to quality sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services that are integrated and youth friendly. The aim of these efforts is to prevent maternal mortality, reduce new HIV infections and eliminate gender-based violence and harmful practices. UNFPA also leads on implementation of the 2gether 4 SRH joint programme, in collaboration with UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO, to scale up SRHR, HIV and sexual and gender-based violence services for all, especially adolescent girls, young people and key populations. The programme provides catalytic support to the government, civil society and communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gavi,23rd August 2023,,https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/every-youths-right-have-child-when-theyre-ready-lesotho-grapples-high-rates-teen,"Eighteen-year-old Lipuo Moleko is the youngest. With her are Boitumelo Mosakeng, 21, Puleng Moleko, 22, Mpho Sebata, 23, and Keneuoe Ramohanoe, 26. Moleko opens the conversation, explaining how she ended up living here – the Centre provides a safe and supportive landing place for young mothers learning to care for themselves and their children. She fell pregnant two years ago, Moleko says, after her friends encouraged her to go out with an ""older, cute and wealthy man"" who works for the government. Her friends advised her to terminate the pregnancy, but ""a senior student told me she aborted her pregnancy and that abortion is the most lonely, painful experience ever. I did not abort,"" Moleko recounts. Moleko believes one of the major causes for high teenage pregnancy is that many families in Lesotho still associate the start of a girl's menstrual periods with sex.  ""The minute a girl starts her menstrual periods, she will be told not to play with boys. Nothing is said about the changes in her body and how she can go about adapting to those changes. Our parents' top priority is ""don't have sex with boys"". Parents need to stop associating menstruation with sex, leaving the responsibility of preventing pregnancy on girls alone,"" Moleko says. Staff member Sister Constance Mosakeng said the Centre is currently home to 29 young mothers and their babies. In most cases, she says, they've been discriminated against by their communities. High rates of teenage pregnancy remain a challenge across Lesotho. Between 2003 and 2018, 94 girls out of every 1,000 in the age group 15–19 gave birth, according to UNFPA. In June this year, at the launch of a radio drama called Let's Talk! Pregnancy at the Right Time, UNESCO National Programme Officer Lineo 'Malesaoana Molapo told a gathering that adolescent girls who fall pregnant mostly hail from rural areas and low socio-economic status. To help ease the high rate of teen pregnancy, UNESCO is supporting Lesotho in developing and implementing a school health and nutrition policy, which includes helping young people access sexual and reproductive health services from health facilities, Molapo said.""Boys and older males in Lesotho can play a crucial role in curbing teenage pregnancy by actively engaging in various initiatives that include challenging traditional gender norms that perpetuate unequal power dynamics between genders."" – Harry Nkhetse, Life Coach""During the [radio] drama, the host will bring in experts, and young people will be allowed to deliberate on the issues, and say how best we can deal with challenges differently and not fall pregnant,"" Molapo said.Life Coach Harry Nkhetse told VaccinesWork that teenage pregnancy is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address it effectively. He echoes teen mum Moleko's point – that responsibility for not becoming pregnant cannot be heaped exclusively onto girls' shoulders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Partners in Health,,,https://www.pih.org/article/expanding-the-role-of-traditional-birth-attendants-in-lesotho,"In the small southern African country of Lesotho, about one out of every four adults is HIV positive, and high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity threaten the country’s young mothers. The rough, mountainous terrain and lack of roads exacerbates the situation, preventing many people from easily accessing the medical services needed to curb the epidemics. To help address these problems, Partners In Health Lesotho (PIHL) is using traditional birth attendants (TBA)—local traditional midwives—to provide women living in rural mountain villages with access to comprehensive services including HIV testing, counselling, and treatment; methods of preventing HIV transmission from mother-to-child; and antenatal (prebirth), delivery, and general post-birth health care; immunizations; as well as general reproductive health services. In May 2009, PIHL, in partnership with the Elton John AIDS Foundation, began to pilot a TBA program in a catchment area that includes 71 villages around PIHL’s health center in Bobete. PIHL hired and trained 100 local women to serve as a link between the clinic and pregnant women—who are literally their neighbors. The TBAs locate and accompany the expectant mothers through their pregnancy and birth to ensure that they have full access to the clinic’s comprehensive services. This includes bringing the women to the clinic to deliver their babies.The TBAs are a part of Lesotho’s traditional midwifery community and PIHL seeks not to replace them, but to further their education and employ them in an expanded role as community health workers in the communities of which they are already a part. And as families traditionally pay TBAs for delivering babies, the PIHL program provides a cash incentive for each woman a TBA accompanies, replacing the income lost when women choose to deliver at the health center. In the first six months of the project, the TBAs completed their training, surveyed their villages, and began to visit pregnant women in their homes. They accompanied 172 women to the clinic for antenatal care, and accompanied 53 women to deliver at the clinic. Clinic deliveries have steadily risen in response to TBA outreach, with at least 24 women giving birth at the health center last month.The advantages of delivering in the Bobete clinic are significant, particularly in preventing the transmission of HIV during childbirth. Delivering with the assistance of a skilled nurse decreases the risks of maternal mortality and morbidity, and infants with health issues can receive immediate medical attention.To enable more women to deliver at the health center, PIHL is renting waiting houses near the clinic that can shelter six women at a time. Rough terrain separating the remote villages from the health center can make the journey virtually impossible for a woman with labor complications, so these houses make it possible for women to make the journey before labor begins.As an extra incentive, PIHL also provides new mothers who fulfil certain criteria (get tested for HIV, attend at least three antenatal visits and deliver their baby at the clinic) with a new baby package, which includes clothing (hat and sweater), pins, and a bathtub. During the programs first six months, PIHL distributed 60 new baby packages.PIHL believes that the accompaniment of the TBAs and the general knowledge and care delivered during the antenatal visits will encourage each woman to deliver her baby at the clinic, and that in doing so families in the Bobete catchment area will see a decrease in HIV mother-to-child transmission rates, as well as maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates. In the coming year, the PIHL team hopes to expand this program to six more rural health centers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Truth Dig,October 26th 2018,,https://www.truthdig.com/articles/child-brides-in-lesotho-lose-their-youth-and-their-future/,"Truthdig is proud to present this article as part of its Global Voices: Truthdig Women Reporting, a series from a network of female correspondents around the world who are dedicated to pursuing truth within their countries and elsewhere. From Latin America to the Middle East, early marriage is a global specter that robs girls of their futures. Instead of attending school and improving their chances in life, child brides face terrifying realities including domestic violence, dangerous early pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.In Lesotho, a mountainous kingdom encircled by South Africa, the number of early marriages is alarming, with nearly one out of five girls marrying before the age of 18. The situation is particularly dire because Lesotho suffers from a devastating HIV epidemic. In recent years, Lesotho human rights advocates have rallied to fight child marriage, but the powerful forces of tradition, poverty and gender inequality still stand in the way of progress. Makabelo Lebate, 21, bursts into tears as she describes her life as a teenage bride. “I was 15 years old and still a virgin when I was married off by my aunt to a man who was 32 years older than me,” she says. “I tried to escape, but I was caught and … locked in the house for three weeks. I was raped almost every day by my husband because I wouldn’t give my consent. [Finally] I couldn’t resist anymore, and I settled down as a wife.” Lebate was 16 when she became pregnant with the first of her three children. “When I went for an HIV test, the results came back positive,” she says. “I told my mother-in-law, as I was afraid of my husband, and I discovered that my husband was already on HIV treatment.” 
Lebate and her husband were uneducated. They lived in poverty in the rural district of Mokhotlong, where it was hard to find work. The nearest health care center was far away, and Lebate often had to go without medication to treat her HIV, which led to further health complications. Child brides are likely to be exposed to sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS because these girls lack power to negotiate sexual terms, says Dr. Molotsi Monyamane, Lesotho’s former minister of health and an expert on sexual and reproductive rights. Early marriages threaten girls’ health and well-being in other ways as well, Dr. Monyamane says. Early pregnancy often follows on the heels of a marriage, even if a girl isn’t physically or mentally ready to bear children. In developing countries, girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are twice as likely as older women to die from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Underlying Poverty Several factors—including poverty—contribute to early marriage in Lesotho and other African countries. “Parents … reduce family expenses by ensuring they have one less person to feed, clothe and educate,” according to the website of Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of organizations committed to ending child marriage. Sometimes the girls’ families receive money as part of the marriage arrangement. Lebate’s aunt agreed to her niece’s marriage because she was promised a dowry in the form of cows, which would help ease her family’s desperate economic situation. (Lebate’s parents had died years earlier, so her aunt wielded authority.) Matselane Linkeng, 24, married early as a means to support her younger siblings. Her mother died when Linkeng was 12 years old, and the girl became the sole bread winner. When she was 16, she met and married a man who was old enough to be her father. Linkeng was lucky as a young bride: The couple were happily married, and her husband helped provide for her siblings. But two years later, her luck ran out. “Things changed when I was 18 and my husband died,” Linkeng says. “My in-laws kicked me out of the house and took everything that belonged to our joint estate. I didn’t have money to institute legal proceedings and ended up leaving with my son, who was 2 years old.” In Lesotho, women whose husbands die are often driven from their homes by their in-laws, who may claim the couple wasn’t legally married. Many widows fight the eviction in court, but Linkeng couldn’t afford the services of a lawyer and didn’t know she could have asked for legal aid services. Tradition and Gender Bias Entrenched cultural mores also drive early marriages. Forced elopement is a traditional practice in which a group of men organize and help one of their members take a girl as his wife, without that girl’s previous knowledge or consent. Malerato Thibella, now 23, lived in the Thaba-Tseka district, where child brides are common. Thibella was “eloped” by a man in a neighbouring village when she was a 16-year-old student. He took her from her home, and when they arrived in the remote area where he lived, she learned she was a second wife. Polygamy is a traditional practice that is legal in Lesotho. She later discovered her parents knew about the arrangement. “I couldn’t believe my ears when I was told that my own father … told this man I would be coming [home] for the school holidays,” Thibella says, with tears running down her cheeks. She rarely visited her parents because her school was far away, so her father’s tipoff set the stage for the abduction. Because she couldn’t come to terms with the fact that she had married a stranger and, worse, that her husband abused her physically and emotionally, she ran away to live with an aunt in Maseru, the capital city. Along with poverty and cultural factors, inherent gender inequality leads to early marriages. In countries such as Lesotho, families often don’t value girls and consider them to be a burden. “Marrying [off] your daughter at a young age can be viewed as a way to [transfer this burden] to her husband’s family,” according to the Girls Not Brides website. The Fight Against Early Marriage Human rights supporters in Lesotho have opposed child marriage for decades and recently stepped up efforts to ban the practice. In April of this year, Princess Senate Mohato Seeiso, 17—a daughter of the king and queen of Lesotho—launched an awareness campaign at an event attended by thousands of teenagers. The princess urged lawmakers and parents to help change underlying social norms that perpetuate early marriage. ‘‘I am making a clarion call to everyone here that [these] are children, not brides,” she said. “Child marriage undermines the rights of young girls in different spheres of life. They … suffer physical, emotional and mental scars.” Last year, Lesotho joined an African Union campaign to end child marriage. The African Union—a continent-wide organization that addresses social, economic and political issues—developed the campaign to promote policy change on early marriage, raise awareness of consequences and build a grassroots movement that includes lawyers, judges, teachers, health and social workers and religious and traditional leaders. Mobilizing these leaders is critical to establishing lasting social change, according to Moeketsi Sello, head of a community in the remote district of Mohale’s Hoek. Sello says traditional leaders are considered champions of local culture, so educating them about the consequences of early marriage leads to educating the public. Mohau Maapesa, a Lesotho attorney and advocate for women’s rights, says practical strategies are essential to change traditional thinking. These include holding educational sessions for parents and community leaders, as well as distributing handouts written in local languages. Initiatives also work to empower girls by educating them about issues such as sexual and reproductive health. The information is especially important among the poorest and most marginalized teenagers in rural areas where child marriage is prevalent. Maapesa says youth groups are an effective way to transmit this vital knowledge. Aftermath for Child Brides Early marriage not only presents physical and emotional threats to teenage girls, but it also affects the rest of their lives. Child brides routinely drop out of school, which usually traps them in financial straits whether or not they stay in the marriage.After years of being physically abused by her husband, Lebate left home with her three children. She moved to Maseru to look for a job, and she now works there as a maid. Her salary is small, but she says she’s able to put bread on the table. She is managing her HIV thanks to regular medication from a nearby clinic. Linkeng is also employed as a maid in Maseru, and she says she and her son live in poverty because she earns so little. Thibella, who doesn’t have children, was one of the fortunate ones when it came to education. With her aunt’s help, she graduated from Limkowing University in Maseru with a bachelor’s degree in education. Thibella works for organizations that promote the rights of girls and women, although she’s currently between jobs. She is vocal about social issues such as abortion, gender equality and early marriage. Lebate strongly supports efforts to protect girls from the fate she endured—and to empower them through knowledge. “I lived my whole childhood like a prisoner without rights, and I [urge people] to rescue these innocent souls,” she says. “Educating girls is one of the most powerful tools to prevent child marriage.” WAIT, BEFORE YOU GO… If you're reading this, you probably already know that non-profit, independent journalism is under threat worldwide.

World Bank Blogs,5th June 2020,,https://blogs.worldbank.org/youth-transforming-africa/how-lesotho-mother-kingdom-managed-eradicate-child-marriages,"In this winning Blog4Dev post, the author imagines a future in which child marriage in Lesotho has been eradicated. “Mama, why does that picture show a 13-year-old girl getting married to an old man?” asked Sello with a frown. The year is 2030, Sello and his mother are at the national museum viewing artifacts. He, a 10-year-old, looks bewildered. ‘Masello, his mother, ventures on to explain the issue of child marriage that used to exist in the past to her son, who looks appalled at the history. “So how did you eradicate this monstrous crime against humanity, mama? This truly feels like a tale.” How did Lesotho achieve eradication of child marriages? Through the effort of everyone in the country. Lesotho believed that it takes a village to raise a child, and through this principle, managed to eradicate what had arguably been the biggest challenge for the country. Through community engagement, citizens began examining the root causes of child marriage. Culture, socio-economic development, low status attached to women and education were identified as some of the root causes for early marriage. With this information, leaders developed a national strategic vision plan to end child marriages with specific timelines, clear targets and indicators. The president began by prioritizing the fight against child marriages in the national budget, which gave the government enough resources to help in fighting child marriages. The customary marriage law, which did not stipulate any age in which a child could be married—thus indirectly endorsing child marriages—was amended and penalties for child marriages were put in place. There were countrywide social mobilization campaigns held in communities where child marriages were rampant.

Since culture was one of the main drivers of child marriages, respected local community leaders were targeted to champion the fight against child marriages. The state ensured that they got local buy-in from the communities, and sensitized and educated them on the importance of educating the girl child and ensuring that all the females in the economy contribute to its meaningful development. The buy-in from the local communities ensured that whenever a child marriage is encountered in the village, it is immediately reported. The main perpetrators of child marriages, males, were targeted intentionally. This was because in order for child marriages to end, the law of supply and demand ascertains that without demand, there would be no supply. In an effort to address socio-economic forces such as poverty and hunger—which often drove parents and caretakers to marry off their children to survive—the government embarked on livelihood diversification strategy to ensure that poverty-stricken communities become poverty free. The nation also adopted a free education system for high schools, where most girls used to drop out of school due to lack of funds. The educational system was also amended to accommodate for young girls who are often married off when they fall pregnant in schools. Girls were enrolled into summer school programs where, in additional to the national curricula, they were taught entrepreneurship skills. “That is how we overcame the impossible,” said ‘Masello.

The Reporter,18th September 2021,,https://www.thereporter.co.ls/2021/09/18/pregnant-teen-forced-into-marriage/,"“I dropped out last year after I found out that I was pregnant, now my mother is forcing me to marry the father of my child.” These are the words of Lineo Motsekuoa (not her real name), a 16-year old girl of Masemousu in the Mafeteng district. Lineo is eight months pregnant. She is one of many girls who fall prey to teenage pregnancy and end up in a loveless marriage as a result. According to a 2021 Unicef case study on delaying adolescent pregnancy and child marriage, getting married as an adolescent is a longstanding practice in Lesotho, as it is in many societies across the Southern Africa region and globally. The drivers of the practice have varied over time and across contexts. Traditionally, these unions were a means of formalising reciprocal relationships between families and solidifying social networks. The social and cultural norms underlying marriage related decisions still inform the choices that girls, boys and their families make. Today, these norms work in concert with two main drivers: poverty and pregnancy. Lineo narrates her story to theReporter newspaper on how she fell pregnant. And now, her mother is forcing her to get married to a teenage boyfriend who is 17 years of age. She now regrets falling for the boy and ultimately not using protective devices when sleeping around. “My now soon-to-be my husband proposed love to me in December 2020 before I visited my relatives in Mohale’s hoek for Christmas holidays.  When I came back in January we started seeing each other regularly. That is when I started falling in love with him. He would tell me how much he loves me and wanted to marry me after I finish school. “I remember on vividly that it was a Saturday when we met and he took me to a hut where he used to sleep in not very far from his parents’ house. His parents had gone for a funeral that day. He took away my virginity. “We did not use protection at all because he promised that I will not be pregnant since it was my first time having sex. I remember asking him if he was sure that I will never fall pregnant and he kept saying I was not going to concieve,” Lineo grunted. With a shy face and looking down during the conversation, Lineo continued to say she only realised she was pregnant when one elderly woman from the village made uncomfortable remarks of her weight. She then became curious and started looking for her menstrual date which she learned it was supposed to be two weeks away. “I started panicking and since I did not have money to buy pregnancy test, I kept my suspicions a secret while at the same time avoiding that elderly woman. I kept going to school but every time someone stared at me I felt like they were seeing my belly growing, “I started wearing my jersey to school and staying indoors after school. I continued with the routine for two months, until one village health worker confronted me. I had no choice but to tell her the truth. I was scared for my life. I kept wishing that the village health worker could not tell my mother who works in South Africa as a domestic worker,” she narrated. She added that when her mother came home in May, she had already heard that she was pregnant. Upon her arrival, she did not ask me a lot of questions but only wanted to know who the father of the child was. “She met with some of our family members to let them know that I was pregnant. My uncles met with the family of my boyfriend about my pregnancy. After the meeting, when the mother came back, she told Lineo that the boy denied that he was the one who impregnated her. Consequently, her mother was furious and kept shouting that the boy will marry her even if he might deny being the father the expected baby. She said her mother would shout that she would not stay with another woman in her house. “I do not like the boy anymore because I feel betrayed by him. He lied to me that I was not going to be pregnant and now when the baby is here, he no longer wants to take responsibility. I understand that we are both still young and still want to go to school but my mother is insisting that I get married. “I wish my mother could help me raise the baby so that I could go back to school because if I get married I will have to stay at home to raise the baby while my husband goes to school,” said Lineo with a frown face. “After I found out I was pregnant, I only stayed in school for four months and no longer wanted to go to school because I couldn’t withstand being stared at by other  pupils who constantly whispered about me,”Lineo said.  ‘Mamoliehi Semousu who is working as a village health worker under ‘Masemousu health centre said health workers try their best to teach the community about the use of contraceptives. She said with the little resources at the disposal, she and others conduct campaigns to alert parents about the use of contraceptives She suggested that most parents believed contraceptives would only make children sexually active. Some still believed that talking about contraceptives and sex was still a taboo that no children should be exposed to such. “They thought their children are being taught about silly or private stuff when they are taught about contraceptives. Now those children are falling pregnant. “Child pregnancy is getting out of control within our communities but parents still won’t let us talk to their children about contraceptives. These children need to use contraceptives because they are already sexually active. “At times we are the ones that break the news about their children’s pregnancy because they still don’t believe their children as young as 12 are already involved in sexual activities. I don’t know if it is ignorance these parents don’t realise that not getting their children on contraceptives is ruining their future because after pregnancy most of them get married at a very young age and forced to leave school,” ‘Mamoliehi said. She added that when they have seen a teenager who is pregnant they help them attend pre- natal check-ups so that they end up delivering in a hospital or clinic. The ministry of social development which is tasked with making sure that parents and children know about the risks of falling pregnant and getting married at a young age says it is still continuing with educating different sectors of the society about child marriage. Speaking to publication, information officer at the ministry of social development, Mpho Makhethe, said her ministry is conducting awareness campaigns that discourage child marriage.  “We have funding from Unicef and World Vision to help us with the campaigns. We are currently sensitising, village health workers, councillors, chiefs and school children. We do this with the hope to get more people to know the risks of child marriage and how they can help prevent it, “The biggest challenge we have recognised within our communities is poverty that forces children to indulge in marriage at young age. “Most of the children nowadays get married because they are now pregnant and for the families of the boy to help raise the child they believe marriage is the only solution,” Makhetha said. Unicef case study on delaying adolescent pregnancy and child marriage continues to show that pregnancy is considered an undesirable condition for an unmarried girl in most communities in Lesotho. Many pregnant girls leave school either because family investment in school fees is no longer considered a priority or affordable. In addition, stigma, discrimination and condemnation from peers and staff make going to school intolerable. The personal and social consequences are also felt within families, which may ill-treat a girl in these circumstances. They experience some sense of shame, disgrace and loss of honour. Community members may also insult and verbally abuse pregnant unmarried girls or treat them in other demeaning ways. The economic penalties may include exacerbated levels of poverty and lower levels of employment and loss of income-earning opportunities.  “Lesotho has a plural legal system in which laws related to child marriage co-exist and contradicts each other, “This lack of harmonization is evident in the Marriage Act (1974), which stipulates that a girl may marry at the age of 16 (and a boy at 18) provided there is parental consent, while the Children’s Protection and Welfare Act (2011) states that marriage before the age of 18 is unlawful, and that a child who is being forced to marry is in need of urgent protection, “International and regional conventions to which Lesotho is a signatory also fix 18 years as the minimum age of marriage. Customary law (Laws of Lerotholi), which governs family and community life in many parts of the country, allows a girl or boy to marry, as long as one has reached puberty,” the report reads. By ‘Majirata Latela “I dropped out last year after I found out that I was pregnant, now my mother is forcing me to marry the father of my child.” These are the words of Lineo Motsekuoa (not her real name), a 16-year old girl of Masemousu in the Mafeteng district. Lineo is eight months pregnant. She is one of many girls who fall prey to teenage pregnancy and end up in a loveless marriage as a result. According to a 2021 Unicef case study on delaying adolescent pregnancy and child marriage, getting married as an adolescent is a longstanding practice in Lesotho, as it is in many societies across the Southern Africa region and globally. 
The drivers of the practice have varied over time and across contexts. Traditionally, these unions were a means of formalising reciprocal relationships between families and solidifying social networks.The social and cultural norms underlying marriage related decisions still inform the choices that girls, boys and their families make. Today, these norms work in concert with two main drivers: poverty and pregnancy.Lineo narrates her story to theReporter newspaper on how she fell pregnant. And now, her mother is forcing her to get married to a teenage boyfriend who is 17 years of age. She now regrets falling for the boy and ultimately not using protective devices when sleeping around.“My now soon-to-be my husband proposed love to me in December 2020 before I visited my relatives in Mohale’s hoek for Christmas holidays.  When I came back in January we started seeing each other regularly. That is when I started falling in love with him. He would tell me how much he loves me and wanted to marry me after I finish school.“I remember on vividly that it was a Saturday when we met and he took me to a hut where he used to sleep in not very far from his parents’ house. His parents had gone for a funeral that day. He took away my virginity.“We did not use protection at all because he promised that I will not be pregnant since it was my first time having sex.

Gender Links,30th June 2020,,https://genderlinks.org.za/news/child-marriages-continue-to-threaten-girls-future/,"Maseru, 30 June: – Arranged child marriages continue to occur in the Thaba Tseka district despite the call by the government for the practice to come to an end. Recently, a 15 year-old girl from Ha Mats’umunyane Thaba Tseka, was forced to marry a 24 year-old man on June 12 2020. She said her only wish is to pursue her studies and become a nurse and not to get married at a such a young age. She said when she arrived there, she was shown a big house which they said it belonged to her, and was told the following day they will go to town to buy the necessities and that included furniture. “I told them I did not want to get married, but to go to school and he told me I will go to school from there, but I told them that could not happen,” she said. She was married at Thaba Khubelu, which is about two hours from her village. Her father also indicated that he could not allow his 15 year old daughter who is in Grade 7 at Lihloahloeng Primary school to get married and have her future ruined unnecessarily. He said he fetched her the following day after reporting the matter to the chief and the Police. He also confirmed his daughter’s marriage was arranged by his sister-in-law as she claimed the man is loaded with cash as he was an illegal miner who just arrived after he disappeared for many years. Speaking to Gender and Child Protection Unit (CGPU) Sergeant Ts’unyane had confirmed that the marriage was arranged by the girl’s relatives adding that reports indicate that the girl was summoned to her aunt’s house, but had no idea why she was called. He continued to state that after her father was informed of her daughter’s marriage, the following day he demanded for the return of her daughter and had taken measures to get her back. “A case was opened and the man was charged with Sexual Offences Act of 2003, and had appeared before the Magistrate court and was released on a bail of M500.00,” he said.Sergeant Ts’unyane has lashed against people who still practice early child marriage saying that child marriage complicate children’s  lives in the long run He appealed to the community to report such incidences to the Police. Speaking to Chief Ts’okoliso Letima of Bobete, he reiterated on the fact that early marriages are still happening in Bobete, but stated that they are not reported, adding that the reason could be that such marriages are arranged. Chief Letima said in his area, orphaned children are the targets for arranged marriages as those who arrange hope that is going to help shift the burden on their shoulders. He said they fail to intervene as family members do not report and they only learn that a child was married when they return as promises are no longer fulfilled, or the child becomes a victim of abuse. He said recently, about three marriages have been reported, and had worked hard to ensure those children return to their homes and allow had given the left everything in the hands of the law. Sexual Reproductive Health Mentor Ms. Ts’ireletso Aporile said the young mothers who are aged between 19 and 24 together with those aged 16 and below who are regarded as high risk are still at the risk of not being able to deliver normally. Aporile said the challenge the high risk and young mothers are faced with include amongst others not attending the antenatal clinics  in a satisfactory way, not being able to express themselves, inability to take care of their young ones and not producing enough breast milk as their nipples have still not developed well. She said their pelvic bones at that age have still not developed and therefore the mother and the newborn child could become vulnerable and end up being disabled. “Lack of nutrition is also a main challenge as they do not eat properly for fear that their pregnancy may show up early, unaware that affects their nutrition status,” she said. Since young mothers could face complications during labour, they are advised to be nearer to the hospital so that if complications occur, Doctors attend to them Phulenyane Matseletsele from Lesobeng Ha Letsika, speaking condemned the practice of early marriages saying marrying young children could lead to loss of lives, and could lead to depression as children get to face a lot of things they cannot solve at an early age as they are still vulnerable. The local authorities such as Chief ‘M’aseepheephe Matete from Manamaneng have indicated that most of the child marriages are not reported adding that because of that, many continue to get married at an early age. In April 2018, Princess Senate was appointed as the National Champion of ending child marriage, as part of efforts to strengthen the campaign against Child Marriage in Lesotho , which was launched in November 2017. She has been holding public gatherings countrywide to campaign against child marriage. In March 2020, she spent the whole week in Thaba Tseka going to hard to reach areas campaigning against child marriage and those included Poopa, Manamaneng, Bobete.In November 2019 Lesotho News Agency (LENA) reported that the government of Lesotho has committed to criminalising early and child marriages to reduce all forms of violence against women and children.According to LENA the then Minister of Development Planning, Dr Tlohelang Aumane had disclosed that when delivering the Government of Lesotho’s commitment to accelerating the promise of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Nairobi. LENA reported that Aumane said the government intends to harmonize all laws in line with the International Gender Equality Protocols and Conventions to prevent gender-based violence and protect women, girls and children. According to UNICEF 17% of girls in Lesotho are married before the age of 18 and 1% are married before their 15th birthday.Girls not brides notes that child marriage is driven by gender inequality and the belief that women and girls are somehow inferior to men and boys. It said there is limited information on child marriage in Lesotho, but available studies suggest that it is driven by traditional customs and limited awareness: Lesotho has committed to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030 in line with target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals. It has also ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992, which sets a minimum age of marriage of 18, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1995, which obligates states to ensure free and full consent to marriage.  Lesotho is one of 20 countries which has committed to ending child marriage by the end of 2020 under the Ministerial Commitment on comprehensive sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents and young people in Eastern and Southern Africa. Reports indicate that child marriage in Lesotho have gone up from 19 to 24 percent. ‘Makuena Linake is a journalist from Lesotho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
International GC,12th May 2021,,https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/stories-histoires/2021/vulnerable-girls-lesotho-filles-vulnerables.aspx?lang=eng,"Through the Pearl Program, Canada supports Help Lesotho’s work in empowering vulnerable girls to fulfill their potential. This program has demonstrated to participants that there are alternatives for young girls in rural areas of Lesotho— an area particularly prone to forced early marriage, early sexual debuts, teenage pregnancy and school dropout. Libuse joined the Pearl Program when she was in grade 7. Through the Program she has improved her confidence and made friends with whom she can discuss important issues such as decision making, healthy relationships, preventing pregnancy, and avoiding HIV-transmission. Libuse has also been inspired by the program’s women guest speakers who have shared their experiences building careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).

Gender Links,9th September 2014,,https://genderlinks.org.za/istories/malenka-nkones-story-2014-06-27/,"I was married to man at the age of 15 and apparently he had already had two wives, I did not know as I was forced into that marriage. I am a Mosotho woman aged 46 and I live at Linakeng, I have six children with different men. I was visiting my uncle at Ha-Letuka and a young woman came claiming that she had a message for me. I went with her to her place and I found the very old man who was apparently my visitor, I was shocked because I did not know him, but he calmed me down and he was very nice seriously but not so that he could be my husband, but we talked and funnily enough, the lady was nowhere to be found.It was around 4pm and he asked me to accompany him to the car wash and he would bring me home. I went because I did not think anything of it, we drove until we got to a place that I had never seen before as I was not staying in that part. He stopped the car and he just changed. He told me straight that he wanted to sleep with me and I told him that I was a virgin and I was not ready to sleep with any man because I was still young, but he did not listen. He forced me and slept with me. It was my first time to sleep with any man and I was so afraid.He told me that he was going to marry me and he had just slept with me therefore I had no choice, he did not use any protection and it was very painful, I was bleeding and I was afraid of what I was going to say to my uncle. When I asked him why he did that to me he said it was because he loved me and wanted to be my husband. I was at a place that I did not know and I did not know where to go. He took me to his place where I found everything arranged as it was planned. They gave me water and I had a bath.
After I had just bathed, he came to me and told me that if I ever tried to run away he was going to kill me. He was very old. I was very afraid and I decided that I would stay because I did not want to die. He did not tell me that he was married and nobody else told me. We stayed together without any problems until we decided that we wanted a child I did not know any thing about children. We tried for two years but failed. He did not take it very well and he blamed me saying that I did not fall pregnant because I had had so many abortions, it was very painful because he was the first man I slept with and he knew it and he even saw that I was bleeding, it was very painful.
I asked him if we could go and see the doctor so that we would be sure what the problem really was, but he refused and it was a difficult situation. He did not want anything to do with seeing the doctor. My marriage was very difficult because my husband talked about children every day and he blamed me but he did not want to see a doctor. One day he came home very drunk and I did not even know that he was drinking and he was with two women and I was already in bed. He asked me to sleep on the mattress because he had visitors and he was going to sleep with them. I told him that he should sleep with them on the mattress, but he shouted at me saying that I was not giving him children.He pushed me out of the bed and threw me down and asked those two women to beat me, but they refused and told him that they would rather sleep with him in front of me than beat me up. He slept with those two women in front of me and he was telling me that I could not give him children therefore I should thank those two women as they were doing me a big favour. I decided to leave him because our situation was very bad. He wanted to sleep with me without protection saying that I was his wife, but I could not agree because he was sleeping with different women. When I mentioned that I was going, he threatened to kill me and I called a doctor in secret to test both of us and it came out that he was the one with the problem.I now have six children with different men and I still believe that I wanted to prove to that man that I could conceive, it still hurts me even now when I see how many children I have and with different men, apparently he kicked out his other two wives because he said they were barren, but he was the one with the problem.This story is part of the “I” Stories series produced by the Gender Links encouraging the view that speaking out can set you free.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
